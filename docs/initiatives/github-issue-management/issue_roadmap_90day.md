- **Impact**: Production service reliability and health checking
- **Effort**: Medium (3-4 days) - Docker and testing framework
- **Owner**: Unassigned (infrastructure/DevOps team)
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Docker service discovery working in development
    - Validation framework for service health
    - Documentation for service discovery setup
- **Dependencies**: Must precede Phase 3 (#1387)
- **Risk**: Medium - Infrastructure complexity

#### 6. **#1365** - Security Documentation Finalization

- **Issue**: Document Dependabot alert resolution process
- **Impact**: Template for future security incident handling
- **Effort**: Small (1 day) - Documentation completion
- **Owner**: Unassigned (security/documentation team)
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Security resolution template created
    - Process documentation complete
    - Future incident workflow defined
- **Dependencies**: None (security work already completed)
- **Risk**: Low - Documentation task

### Sprint 2 Success Metrics

- **Post-mortem action items** implemented and tested
- **Service discovery** working in Docker development environment
- **Security process** documented and usable for future incidents
- **PR troubleshooting time** reduced by 50%+ (target <3 hours)

## Long-term Roadmap (Week 7-12)

### Month 2: Infrastructure Completion

- **Service Discovery Phase 4** (#1388) - Cross-service integration
- **Dashboard Modernization Phases 2-4** (#1119-1122) - Component implementation
- **Bridge Platform Completion** (#1254, #1255, #1257) - Full integration platform

### Month 3: Feature Development

- **Training Simulation Module** (#1287) - Developer onboarding
- **OpenAPI Integration** (#1231, #1235-1237) - API documentation automation
- **Advanced CI Analytics** (#1012) - Predictive failure analysis

## Critical Success Factors

### Resource Requirements

1. **Immediate Assignment Needed**:

   - Infrastructure/DevOps Lead (Service Discovery, Docker)
   - Process Improvement Lead (Issue Templates, Post-Mortem)
   - Automation Engineer (Markdown Compliance, CI Enhancement)

2. **Skill Dependencies**:

   - Docker/Service Mesh expertise for service discovery
   - UI/React expertise for dashboard modernization
   - Python automation for script generation improvements

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Single Point of Failure**: @reesey275 is only assignee for critical Bridge work

   - **Mitigation**: Cross-train team member on Bridge platform

2. **Large Effort Issues**: Several medium-large effort items in pipeline

   - **Mitigation**: Break down into smaller deliverable chunks

3. **Dependency Chains**: Service discovery phases must be sequential

   - **Mitigation**: Ensure Phase 2 success before committing to Phase 3

### Success Tracking

- **Weekly Issue Health Review**: Track completion rates and blockers
- **Sprint Retrospectives**: Identify process improvements
- **Monthly Roadmap Updates**: Adjust priorities based on business needs

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Assign Sprint 1 Issues** - Get ownership for #1437, #1315
2. **Effort Estimation Session** - Label remaining 49 issues with effort estimates
3. **Priority Triage Meeting** - Label remaining 37 issues with priorities
4. **Resource Planning** - Identify team members for infrastructure and automation work
