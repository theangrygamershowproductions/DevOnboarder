### **Session Goal**: Create robust plan of attack for 58 open GitHub issues

### **Status**: FRAMEWORK COMPLETE - Ready for execution

## Work Completed This Session

###  **Analysis Phase Complete**

1. **Issue Inventory**: Exported and analyzed all 58 open issues

2. **Pattern Analysis**: Identified critical gaps and strategic themes

3. **Framework Creation**: Built comprehensive prioritization system

###  **Planning Phase Complete**

1. **90-Day Roadmap**: 3-sprint execution plan with specific issues

2. **Resource Analysis**: Identified skill dependencies and bottlenecks

3. **Success Metrics**: Defined measurable outcomes and targets

###  **Documentation Complete**

1. **`issue_analysis_framework.md`** - Deep analytical foundation (same directory)

2. **`issue_roadmap_90day.md`** - Tactical execution plan (same directory)

3. **`executive_summary_issue_strategy.md`** - Strategic overview (same directory)

## Critical Findings Summary

### **Immediate Priorities**

- **Triage Gap**: 63.8% of issues lack priority labels

- **Planning Gap**: 84.5% of issues lack effort estimation

### **Strategic Patterns**

- **Infrastructure-Heavy**: 27.6% of issues (16 total)

- **Bridge Platform**: 5 issues for new integration platform

- **Service Discovery**: Systematic 3-phase development approach

## Immediate Next Steps (Ready to Execute)

### **This Week (September 16-22)**

1. **Assign Sprint 1 Ownership**

   - #1437 - Issue closure template system

   - #1315 - Markdown compliance automation

2. **Complete Issue Triage**
