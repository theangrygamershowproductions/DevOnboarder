# Developer Onboarding

Welcome to **DevOnboarder**. This page explains how to get your environment running and where to find documentation about our workflow.

## Local Development

1. Run `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh` to create `.env.dev` and install dependencies
   (including `httpx` and `uvicorn`).
2. Install the project in editable mode with `pip install -e .`.
3. Start services with `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d`.
4. Alternatively, run `devonboarder-server` to start the app without Docker. Stop it with Ctrl+C.
5. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to see the greeting server.
6. Run `devonboarder-api` to start the user API at `http://localhost:8001`.
   This command requires `uvicorn`.
7. Run `devonboarder-auth` to start the auth service at `http://localhost:8002`.
   It stores data in a local SQLite database.
8. Test the XP API with:
   `curl http://localhost:8001/api/user/onboarding-status`
   and `curl http://localhost:8001/api/user/level`.
9. Stop services with `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml down`.
10. Verify changes with `ruff check .` and `pytest -q` before committing.
11. Install git hooks with `pre-commit install` so these checks run automatically.
