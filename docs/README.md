# Developer Onboarding

Welcome to **DevOnboarder**. This page explains how to get your environment running and where to find documentation about our workflow.

## Local Development

1. Run `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh` to create `.env.dev` and install dependencies.
2. Install the project in editable mode with `pip install -e .`.
3. Start services with `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d`.
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to see the greeting server.
5. Verify changes with `ruff check .` and `pytest -q` before committing.
6. Install git hooks with `pre-commit install` so these checks run automatically.
