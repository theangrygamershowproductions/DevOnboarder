# Developer Onboarding

Welcome to **DevOnboarder**. This page explains how to get your environment running and where to find documentation about our workflow.

## Local Development

1. Run `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh` to create `.env.dev` and install dependencies
   (including `httpx` and `uvicorn`).
   Update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.dev` if you are not using the default
   Postgres credentials.
2. Install the project in editable mode with `pip install -e .`.
3. Start services with `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml --env-file .env.dev up -d`.
   This launches the auth, bot, XP API, frontend, and Postgres services.
   The `frontend/` folder currently contains only a placeholder README.
4. Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply the initial database migration.
5. Alternatively, run `devonboarder-server` to start the app without Docker. Stop it with Ctrl+C.
6. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to see the greeting server.
7. Run `devonboarder-api` to start the user API at `http://localhost:8001`.
   This command requires `uvicorn`.
8. Run `devonboarder-auth` to start the auth service at `http://localhost:8002`.
   It stores data in a local SQLite database.
9. Test the XP API with:
   `curl http://localhost:8001/api/user/onboarding-status`
   and `curl http://localhost:8001/api/user/level`.
10. Stop services with `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml --env-file .env.dev down`.
11. Verify changes with `ruff check .` and `pytest -q` before committing.
12. Install git hooks with `pre-commit install` so these checks run automatically.

The compose files define common service settings using YAML anchors. Each
environment file overrides differences like `env_file` or exposed ports below the
`<<` merge key.
