# Developer Onboarding

Welcome to **DevOnboarder**. This page explains how to get your environment running and where to find documentation about our workflow.

If you're setting up a fresh Ubuntu machine, follow [ubuntu-setup.md](ubuntu-setup.md) for the commands that install Docker, Docker Compose, Node.js 22, and Python 3.13.
## Local Development

1. Run `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh` to create `.env.dev` and install dependencies
   (including `httpx` and `uvicorn`).
   Update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.dev` if you are not using the default
   Postgres credentials.
2. Generate throwaway secrets with `./scripts/generate-secrets.sh`.
   This script overwrites `.env.dev` with fresh random values.
3. Build the service containers with `make deps`.
4. Install the project in editable mode with `pip install -e .`.
   Install the dev requirements with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
5. Start services with `make up` or run
   `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml --env-file .env.dev up -d`.
   This launches the auth, bot, XP API, frontend, and Postgres services.
   The `frontend/` folder now hosts a React app built with Vite.
6. Run `bash scripts/run_migrations.sh` to apply the initial database migration.
7. Alternatively, run `devonboarder-server` to start the app without Docker. Stop it with Ctrl+C.
8. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to see the greeting server.
9. Run `devonboarder-api` to start the user API at `http://localhost:8001`.
   This command requires `uvicorn`.
10. Run `devonboarder-auth` to start the auth service at `http://localhost:8002`.
   It stores data in a local SQLite database.
11. Test the XP API with:
   `curl http://localhost:8001/api/user/onboarding-status`
   and `curl http://localhost:8001/api/user/level`.
12. Stop services with `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml --env-file .env.dev down`.
13. Verify changes with `ruff check .`, `pytest -q`, and `npm test` from the `bot/` directory before committing.
    Install the project and dev requirements **before running the tests**:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .  # or `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you have one
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```
14. Install git hooks with `pre-commit install` so these checks run automatically.
15. Lint all Markdown docs with `./scripts/check_docs.sh` before pushing.
    This script uses **Vale** for style and **LanguageTool** for grammar.
    LanguageTool requires network access to `api.languagetool.org` unless you
    provide a custom server URL in the `LANGUAGETOOL_URL` environment variable.
    If your environment blocks outbound requests, run your own instance with:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name languagetool -p 8010:8010 silviof/docker-languagetool
    ```

    Then set `LANGUAGETOOL_URL=http://localhost:8010/v2`.

The compose files define common service settings using YAML anchors. Each
environment file overrides differences like `env_file` or exposed ports below the
`<<` merge key.

### Platform Verification

These instructions were tested on Windows 11 (with WSL&nbsp;2), macOS Ventura,
and Ubuntu&nbsp;22.04. The Docker and Python versions match across
platforms. Please report any issues you encounter on your operating system.

## Onboarding Phases

Our rollout begins with invite-only [alpha testing](alpha/README.md) followed by
the **Founder's Circle** outlined in [founders/README.md](founders/README.md).
These groups provide early feedback before the project opens to the public.

## XP Milestones

Each contribution grants experience points (XP). Every 100 XP increases your
level, which you can check through the `/profile` command or the
`/api/user/level` endpoint.

## Contributor Logging

Add yourself to [../ALPHA_TESTERS.md](../ALPHA_TESTERS.md) or
[../FOUNDERS.md](../FOUNDERS.md) when you participate. These logs help us track
who has contributed and when.

## Configuration Helpers

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` &ndash; run `pre-commit install` to set up git hooks that execute the linter and tests.
- `.editorconfig` &ndash; ensures consistent indentation and line endings across editors.
- `.python-version` &ndash; indicates the Python version for pyenv.
- `.nvmrc` &ndash; defines the Node.js version for nvm.

## Documentation Quality Checks

All Markdown files must pass Vale and LanguageTool checks.
See [doc-quality-onboarding.md](doc-quality-onboarding.md) for a step-by-step guide.

- Run `bash scripts/check_docs.sh` before pushing any changes.
- Install Vale (version 3.4.2) with `brew install vale` or download it from the
  [Vale releases page](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases).
- If your network blocks direct downloads, fetch version 3.4.2 from
  `https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases` on another machine and copy the
  `vale` binary to a directory in your `PATH`.
- Install Python dev dependencies with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
- Set `LANGUAGETOOL_URL` if you use a self-hosted LanguageTool server. See the [LanguageTool HTTP server guide](https://dev.languagetool.org/http-server).

## Issues and Pull Requests

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates and provide clear reproduction steps.
2. Start branches from the latest `main` and follow the git guidelines.
3. Use the pull request template and ensure the checklist passes.
4. Review [sample-pr.md](sample-pr.md) for an end-to-end example.
5. See the Codex CI Monitoring Policy in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for how failed CI jobs automatically create tasks.
