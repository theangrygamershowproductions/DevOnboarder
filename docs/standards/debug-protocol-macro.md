# ðŸ§© Debug Protocol Macro (v1.2)

## Overview

The Debug Protocol Macro is a drop-in debugging framework that enforces disciplined, test-first reasoning and structured output for technical problem resolution. This protocol can be pasted at the top of any debugging session to force systematic analysis and comprehensive solutions.

## Purpose

* **Structured Problem Solving**: Forces ranked hypotheses and explicit falsification steps

* **Test-First Approach**: Requires validation and rollback plans for all changes

* **Copy-Paste Ready**: Generates immediately actionable commands and code

* **Smallest Safe Change**: Keeps solutions minimal and risk-aware

* **Cross-Domain Flexibility**: Adaptable to CI/CD, Backend, Frontend, Security, and Infrastructure issues

## Protocol Template

````markdown

# DEBUG_PROTOCOL

mode: "ASSUME"            # ASSUME = don't ask me questions; make reasonable assumptions and proceed. (Other option: CONFIRM)

domain: "CI/CD|DevOps"    # Examples: "Backend", "Frontend", "Data", "Security", "Infra", "CI/CD"

constraints:
  - "No secrets; redact tokens."

  - "No fabricated commands, files, or tool flags."

  - "Prefer smallest safe change."

  - "All fixes must include a validation step + rollback."

inputs:
  problem_summary: "<1â€“3 lines>"
  env_facts: ["OS","shell","runner","versions","repo/branch","recent change"]
  evidence: ["error lines", "logs", "screens", "commands tried"]

# OUTPUT CONTRACT â€” respond in EXACTLY these sections

1) Situation Snapshot

- One-paragraph plain-English summary.

- Key signals (bullet list). Distinguish symptom vs. cause candidates.

2) Hypotheses (Ranked)

- H1 ...  (why it fits / how to falsify)

- H2 ...

- H3 ...

3) Minimal Repro Plan

- Steps 1..N to reproduce; include expected vs. actual for each step.

4) Evidence to Collect (Ordered, Cheap â†’ Expensive)

- Logs/commands/paths with exact invocations.

- Note what each item will confirm or deny.

5) Fix Plan (Smallest Safe Change)

- Change set (files/lines/commands).

- Risk level + blast radius.

- Rollback plan (exact steps).

6) Validation (Pass/Fail Gates)

- Pre-commit checks (lint/tests)

- Runtime assertions / health checks

- "Definition of Done" (explicit)

7) Commands/Edits (Copy-Paste Ready)

```bash

# bash/zsh here (only real, version-safe flags)

```

```pwsh

# powershell here (no pseudo cmdlets)

```

```yaml

# config snippet if relevant

```

8. Postmortem Notes (Optional)

* What prevented this earlier? Guardrail to add (lint, CI step, monitor, doc).

* One automation to stop this class of issue recurring.

# RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

* If mode = ASSUME, proceed without questions; state assumptions up front.

* Cite real tool flags/paths; if unknown, mark as TODO and provide a safe probe.

* Prefer diffs/patch snippets for file edits.

* Never skip Validation or Rollback.

# END DEBUG\_PROTOCOL

## Domain-Specific Variants

### Code Bug (Backend)

For backend debugging sessions, enhance the protocol with:

* Add a "Unit Test First" sub-step in **Minimal Repro Plan**

* Require a failing test diff in **Commands/Edits**

* Include database state validation in **Validation** section

### Frontend/UI

For frontend debugging sessions, enhance with:

* Add a "User-visible acceptance step" (screenshot/DOM selector) under **Validation**

* Include browser compatibility checks

* Require visual regression tests where applicable

### Data/Pipeline

For data and pipeline debugging sessions, enhance with:

* Add a "Data Integrity Checks" block (row counts, null ratios, schema drift) in **Validation**

* Include data lineage verification

* Require rollback procedures for data changes

### Security

For security-related debugging sessions, enhance with:

* Add CWE mapping + mitigation level

* Require "exploit pre/post" steps in **Validation**

* Include threat model impact assessment

* Mandate security review for all changes

## Example Usage: CI/CD GitHub CLI Flag Regression

### Input

```markdown
problem_summary: "Workflow `close-codex-issues.yml` fails on runner with `gh: unknown flag --jq`."
env_facts: Windows + Ubuntu runners; gh 2.0â€“2.54 variance; jq not installed on Windows.

evidence: Action log shows `gh issue close --jq` errors.

```

### Expected Response Structure

#### 1) Situation Snapshot

`gh` on some runners doesn't support `--jq`; workflow assumes it. Symptom: job fails at issue-close step. Likely cause: using unsupported flags + missing `jq` dependency.

#### 2) Hypotheses (Ranked)

* H1: `gh` version < 2.4 where `--jq` isn't available; falsify by `gh --version`.

* H2: Step runs on Windows where `jq` absent; falsify by `jq --version` (expect failure).

* H3: Flag is deprecated/never supported on current channel; falsify via `gh help`.

#### 3) Minimal Repro Plan

1. `gh --version` on failing runner â†’ expect older/newer mismatch.

2. `jq --version` â†’ expect not found on Windows.

3. Re-run step with `--jq` removed â†’ expect pass.

#### 4) Evidence to Collect

* `which gh && gh --version` (confirms H1)

* `which jq && jq --version` (confirms H2)

* `gh help issue close` (validates flag support)

#### 5) Fix Plan (Smallest Safe Change)

* Remove `--jq` usage; parse issue number from returned URL/string.

* Add version guard + fallback path (POSIX parsing).

* Risk: Low; affects only issue-close step.

* Rollback: Revert single commit.

#### 6) Validation (Pass/Fail Gates)

* CI green on Ubuntu + Windows.

* Dry-run with a dummy issue in sandbox repo.

* Log shows "Closed issue #NUM" without `jq`.

#### 7) Commands/Edits

```yaml

# .github/workflows/close-codex-issues.yml (snippet)

- name: Close Issue (version-safe)

  shell: bash
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    issue_url="$(gh issue close "$ISSUE_ID" -R "$REPO" -c "Auto-closed by CI" -o json 2>/dev/null || true)"
    if [[ -z "${issue_url}" ]]; then
      # Fallback: no -o json support; use URL echo + grep

      close_out="$(gh issue close "$ISSUE_ID" -R "$REPO" -c "Auto-closed by CI" 2>&1 || true)"
      # Extract issue number from the printed URL or text

      num="$(printf "%s" "$close_out" | grep -Eo '#[0-9]+' | head -n1 | tr -d '#')"
      echo "Closed issue #${num:-$ISSUE_ID}"
    else
      num="$(printf "%s" "$issue_url" | grep -Eo '"number":[ ]*[0-9]+' | grep -Eo '[0-9]+')"
      echo "Closed issue #${num:-$ISSUE_ID}"
    fi

```

```bash

# Validation probes

gh --version
gh issue create -R "$REPO" -t "CI Sandbox" -b "ok" | tee /tmp/issue_url
ISSUE_ID=$(sed -E 's@.*/issues/([0-9]+).*@\1@' /tmp/issue_url)

# run the workflow or call the action locally if supported

```

#### 8. Postmortem Notes

* Guardrail: add `gh version check` step + fallback parsing pattern.

* Monitor: alert on any `unknown flag` in Action logs.

## Integration with DevOnboarder

### Alignment with DevOnboarder Philosophy

This Debug Protocol Macro aligns perfectly with DevOnboarder's **"quiet reliability"** philosophy by:

* **Enforcing systematic thinking** before making changes

* **Requiring validation and rollback plans** for all modifications

* **Promoting smallest safe changes** to minimize risk

* **Generating copy-paste ready solutions** that work reliably

### Integration Points

**CI/CD Integration**:

* Use with `scripts/qc_pre_push.sh` validation framework

* Integrate with AAR (After Action Report) system

* Align with Root Artifact Guard and CI Triage Guard enforcement

**Quality Control**:

* Supports DevOnboarder's 95% quality threshold requirement

* Enforces pre-commit validation in debugging workflow

* Maintains virtual environment requirements and safe commit practices

**Documentation Standards**:

* Follows DevOnboarder markdown compliance standards

* Integrates with existing troubleshooting documentation

* Supports centralized logging and artifact management

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use

* **Complex technical issues** requiring systematic analysis

* **CI/CD failures** with unclear root causes

* **Cross-service integration problems** with multiple potential causes

* **Security incidents** requiring careful analysis and mitigation

* **Performance issues** needing systematic investigation

### When NOT to Use

* **Simple configuration changes** with obvious solutions

* **Well-documented issues** with established fixes

* **Emergency hotfixes** where time is critical (use after resolution for postmortem)

### Best Practices

1. **Always use ASSUME mode** for efficient problem resolution

2. **Document assumptions clearly** when proceeding without confirmation

3. **Prioritize cheapest evidence collection** to validate hypotheses quickly

4. **Include explicit rollback plans** for all proposed changes

5. **Generate actionable commands** that can be executed immediately
