# Security Audit - 2025-06-21

We ran dependency audits for both Python and Node packages.

## Python (`pip-audit`)

`pip-audit` could not complete in the Codex environment due to restricted network access.
No issues were identified in the partial results.

## Node (`npm audit`)

`npm audit` reported zero vulnerabilities across all dependencies.
