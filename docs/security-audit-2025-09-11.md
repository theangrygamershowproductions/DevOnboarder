# Security Audit - 2025-09-11

We ran dependency audits for Python and Node packages and scanned the code with Bandit.

## Python (`pip-audit`)

### ⚠️ Ignored Vulnerabilities (Require Periodic Review)

The following vulnerabilities are currently ignored:

```text

# DevOnboarder pip-audit ignore configuration

# This file contains security vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed

# due to upstream maintainer decisions or lack of available patches

#
# CRITICAL: All ignored vulnerabilities must be documented in

# docs/security-ignore-registry.md with quarterly review schedules

#
# GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp: Timing attack in python-ecdsa on P-256 curve

# - Affects: ecdsa 0.19.1 (required by python-jose for JWT functionality)

# - Severity: Low (timing attacks affect signing operations, not verification)

# - Status: No planned fix according to maintainers (considered 'out of scope')

# - Impact: DevOnboarder uses JWT verification (not signing) so minimal risk

# - First ignored: 2025-07-30

# - Next review: 2025-10-30

GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp

```

**ACTION REQUIRED**: These ignored vulnerabilities should be reviewed quarterly.
Next review due: 2025-12-11

tmp  <=0.2.3
tmp allows arbitrary temporary file / directory write via symbolic link `dir` parameter - [GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6)

fix available via `npm audit fix --force`
Will install @lhci/cli@0.1.0, which is a breaking change
node_modules/@lhci/cli/node_modules/tmp
node_modules/external-editor/node_modules/tmp
  @lhci/cli  *
  Depends on vulnerable versions of inquirer

  Depends on vulnerable versions of tmp
  node_modules/@lhci/cli
  external-editor  >=1.1.1

```console

    inquirer  3.0.0 - 8.2.6 || 9.0.0 - 9.3.7

4 low severity vulnerabilities

To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force
```

**Resolution Approach for tmp Vulnerability (CVE-2025-54798)**:

Instead of upgrading parent packages (@lhci/cli and external-editor) or using `npm audit fix --force`, we implemented package overrides to force secure tmp@^0.2.5 for all nested dependencies. This approach was chosen for several reasons:

1. **Avoiding Breaking Changes**: The npm audit suggested `@lhci/cli@0.1.0` which would be a major breaking change

2. **Targeted Security Fix**: Package overrides specifically address the vulnerability without affecting other functionality

3. **Production Bundle Safety**: Keeps tmp out of production dependencies since it's only needed by development tools

4. **DevOnboarder Standards Compliance**: Follows npm security standards for nested dependency resolution

The fix uses package.json overrides configuration:

```json
"overrides": {
    "tmp": "^0.2.5"
}

```

This forces all packages that depend on tmp (including @lhci/cli and external-editor) to use the secure version, resolving the vulnerability without introducing breaking changes or unnecessary direct dependencies.
