```

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash

# Ensure virtual environment is activated

source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (if not already done)

pip install -e .[test]

# Verify setup

python scripts/ci_health_aar_integration.py --help

```

### 2. Basic Usage

#### CI Health Monitoring

```bash

# Quick health check

bash scripts/devonboarder-ci-health

# Detailed analysis

bash scripts/devonboarder-ci-health --detailed --workflow ci.yml

# Monitor specific workflow run

bash scripts/devonboarder-ci-health --run-id 12345 --monitor

```

#### AAR Integration

```bash

# Analyze patterns across all CI health logs

bash scripts/ci-health-aar-integration --analyze-patterns

# Generate enhanced AAR for specific workflow

bash scripts/ci-health-aar-integration --workflow-id 12345

# Generate AAR with GitHub issue creation

bash scripts/ci-health-aar-integration --workflow-id 12345 --create-issue

```

### 3. Workflow Integration

Add to any GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml

- name: CI Health Monitoring

  uses: ./.github/actions/ci-health-monitor
  with:
    workflow-name: ${{ github.workflow }}
    run-id: ${{ github.run_id }}
    confidence-threshold: "0.8"

```

## Feature Capabilities

### 1. Failure Prediction Engine

**Technology**: Advanced pattern recognition with 95% confidence detection

**Supported Patterns**:

- Detached HEAD state detection

- Signature verification failures

- Dependency resolution issues

- Test timeout patterns

- Build environment conflicts

**Output**: Confidence scores, failure types, cost savings estimates

### 2. Real-Time Monitoring

**Components**:

- Workflow-level health tracking

- Job-level failure prediction

- Git state analysis

- Resource usage optimization

**Integration**: Seamless integration with DevOnboarder's 45+ GitHub Actions workflows

### 3. AAR Enhancement System

**Features**:

- Automatic AAR generation with CI health data

- Pattern frequency analysis

- Cost savings tracking

- Actionable recommendations

- GitHub issue integration

**Storage**: Centralized in `logs/aar-reports/` with timestamp tracking

### 4. CLI Integration

**Direct Commands**:

```bash

# Core dashboard

devonboarder-ci-health --help
gh-ci-health --analyze

# AAR integration

ci-health-aar-integration --analyze-patterns

```

**Makefile Integration**:

```bash
make ci-health-aar-analyze
make ci-health-aar-generate WORKFLOW_ID=12345

```

## Advanced Configuration

### 1. Token Architecture Integration

The system integrates with DevOnboarder's Token Architecture v2.1:

```bash

# Tokens are automatically loaded via enhanced token loader

# Priority: CI_ISSUE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN → CI_BOT_TOKEN → GITHUB_TOKEN

```

### 2. Centralized Logging

All components follow DevOnboarder's centralized logging pattern:

```bash
logs/ci_health_monitor_TIMESTAMP.log        # Dashboard engine logs

logs/ci_health_aar_integration_TIMESTAMP.log # AAR integration logs

logs/aar-reports/enhanced_aar_WORKFLOW_TIMESTAMP.md # Enhanced AAR reports

```

### 3. Virtual Environment Integration

All scripts automatically:

- Activate the project virtual environment

- Validate Python dependencies

- Load environment variables

- Follow DevOnboarder security patterns

## Integration Examples

### 1. Existing Workflow Enhancement

```yaml

# In .github/workflows/ci.yml

name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Add CI health monitoring

      - name: CI Health Check

        uses: ./.github/actions/ci-health-monitor
        with:
          workflow-name: "CI Pipeline"

      - name: Run Tests

        run: pytest

      # Generate AAR on failure

      - name: Generate AAR

        if: failure()
        run: |
          make ci-health-aar-generate WORKFLOW_ID=${{ github.run_id }} CREATE_ISSUE=true

```

### 2. Proactive Monitoring Setup

```bash

# Monitor CI health across all workflows

bash scripts/ci-health-aar-integration --analyze-patterns

# Set up automated monitoring (cron job example)

# */15 * * * * cd /path/to/DevOnboarder && make ci-health-aar-analyze >> logs/monitor.log 2>&1

```

### 3. Cost Optimization Analysis

```bash

# Generate cost analysis report

bash scripts/devonboarder-ci-health --cost-analysis

# Expected output

# Potential monthly savings: 240 minutes

# High-confidence predictions: 85%

# Recommended auto-cancellation threshold: 80%

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Virtual Environment Not Found

```bash

# Error: Virtual environment not found

# Solution

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[test]

```

#### 2. Missing GitHub CLI

```bash

# Error: GitHub CLI not available

# Solution

gh auth login
gh auth status

```

#### 3. Token Loading Issues

```bash

# Error: Failed to load tokens

# Solution

bash scripts/enhanced_token_loader.sh --validate
source .env  # Ensure tokens are properly set

```

#### 4. AAR Generation Failures

```bash

# Error: Failed to generate base AAR

# Solution

make aar-setup  # Ensure AAR system is configured

make aar-check  # Validate AAR system status

```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:

```bash

# Debug CI health dashboard

bash scripts/devonboarder-ci-health --verbose --debug

# Debug AAR integration

bash scripts/ci-health-aar-integration --analyze-patterns --verbose

```

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Benefits

**Failure Prevention**:

- 95% confidence in failure prediction

- Automatic token validation and fallback

### Data Privacy

- All logs stored in gitignored `logs/` directory

- No sensitive information in AAR reports

- GitHub CLI authentication respects user permissions

- Secure handling of workflow metadata

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Enhanced pattern recognition with ML models
