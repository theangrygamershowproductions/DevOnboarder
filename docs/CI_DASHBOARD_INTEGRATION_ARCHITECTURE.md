# DevOnboarder CI Dashboard Integration v1.0

## Overview

The CI Dashboard Integration provides real-time monitoring, failure prediction, and automated remediation for DevOnboarder's 45+ GitHub Actions workflows. Built upon the existing Token Architecture v2.1 and integrated with the AAR system, it enables proactive CI health management.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Dashboard Engine (`scripts/devonboarder_ci_health.py`)

**Primary Functions:**

- Real-time workflow monitoring across all 45+ workflows
- Failure pattern detection and prediction
- **PR Comment Analysis Integration**: Correlates Copilot suggestions with CI failures
- Integration with Token Architecture v2.1 for authentication
- Automated remediation recommendations
- AAR system integration for failure analysis

**Key Features:**

- **Detached HEAD Detection**: Based on real 2025-09-13 failure analysis
- **Signature Verification Monitoring**: Prevents merge-blocking issues
- **PR-CI Correlation Engine**: Links reviewer comments to CI failure patterns
- **Resource Cost Optimization**: Early cancellation saves compute time
- **Pattern Learning**: ML-style pattern recognition for recurring issues

**Documentation & Process Integration:**

- **Process Guide**: Complete workflow documentation at `docs/processes/pr-ci-integration-guide.md`
- **Agent Integration**: CI Helper Agent (`agents/ci-helper-agent.md`) with PR-CI capabilities
- **Automation Examples**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated analysis

**PR Analysis Capabilities:**

- **Comment Extraction**: Analyzes Copilot and reviewer inline comments
- **Suggestion Categorization**: Identifies code suggestions vs general feedback
- **CI Correlation**: Links suggestions to current CI check failures
- **Priority Scoring**: Calculates urgency based on comment-CI relationships
- **Integrated Recommendations**: Provides unified feedback for developers

### 2. CLI Integration (`devonboarder-ci-health` command)

**Available Commands:**

```bash
# Real-time dashboard
devonboarder-ci-health                    # Full dashboard view
devonboarder-ci-health --branch BRANCH   # Branch-specific analysis
devonboarder-ci-health --live             # Live monitoring mode
devonboarder-ci-health --predict          # Failure prediction only

# PR Analysis Integration (NEW)
devonboarder-ci-health --diagnose-pr PR_NUM  # Integrated PR comment + CI analysis
devonboarder-ci-health --diagnose-pr 1397    # Example: analyze PR 1397

# Quick status checks
gh-ci-health                             # CLI shortcut (existing)
gh-dashboard                             # Enhanced comprehensive view
```

### 3. Workflow Integration Points

**Target Workflows for Integration:**

1. **ci.yml** - Main test pipeline
2. **priority-matrix-synthesis.yml** - Auto-synthesis workflow
3. **documentation-quality.yml** - Doc validation
4. **terminal-policy-enforcement.yml** - Policy compliance
5. **root-artifact-monitor.yml** - Artifact hygiene
6. **All 45+ workflows** - Pattern collection

**Integration Methods:**

- **Step Monitoring**: Real-time log analysis
- **Pre-flight Checks**: Validation before expensive operations
- **Post-failure Analysis**: Pattern extraction for learning
- **Auto-remediation**: Smart cancellation and retry logic

### 4. Token Architecture Integration

**Authentication Flow:**

```bash
# Primary: CI automation tokens (Token Architecture v2.1)
CI_ISSUE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN → CI_BOT_TOKEN → GITHUB_TOKEN

# Fallback: Use enhanced_token_loader.sh for reliable authentication
source scripts/enhanced_token_loader.sh
```

**Permissions Required:**

- `actions:read` - Workflow run analysis
- `contents:read` - Repository access for log analysis
- `issues:write` - Auto-issue creation for persistent failures
- `pull_requests:read` - PR-specific workflow analysis and comment extraction
- `pull_requests:write` - PR comment creation for integrated analysis results

### 5. AAR System Integration

**Automated AAR Triggers:**

- Critical workflow failures (>3 consecutive failures)
- Pattern-based failure detection (detached HEAD, signature issues)
- Resource waste detection (cancelled workflows due to predictable failures)
- Integration with existing `make aar-generate` system

**AAR Enhancement:**

- Include prediction accuracy metrics
- Document prevented failures and cost savings
- Pattern analysis for proactive improvements

### 6. PR-CI Integration System (NEW)

**Unified Analysis Workflow:**

The `--diagnose-pr` command provides comprehensive analysis combining:

1. **PR Comment Extraction** (`scripts/check_pr_inline_comments.sh`)
   - Copilot code suggestions
   - Reviewer feedback and concerns
   - Resolution tracking and patterns

2. **CI Status Analysis** (GitHub CLI integration)
   - Real-time check status (passed/failed/pending)
   - Failure pattern detection
   - Resource usage optimization

3. **Correlation Engine** (Python integration)
   - Links Copilot suggestions to CI failures
   - Calculates confidence scores for correlations
   - Generates priority-based recommendations

**Integration Benefits:**

- **Faster PR Review**: Combines human and automated feedback in single view
- **Targeted Fixes**: Identifies which Copilot suggestions address current CI failures
- **Developer Efficiency**: Reduces context switching between PR comments and CI logs
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from comment-CI relationships over time

**Usage Patterns:**

```bash
# Before starting PR review
devonboarder-ci-health --diagnose-pr 1397

# During CI failure investigation
devonboarder-ci-health --diagnose-pr 1397 | grep -A5 "HIGH PRIORITY"

# For automated analysis in workflows
scripts/devonboarder_ci_health.py --diagnose-pr $PR_NUMBER --format json
```

**Agent Integration Points:**

- **PR Review Agent**: Can use integrated analysis for smarter review comments
- **CI Helper Agent**: Enhanced with PR context for better failure resolution guidance
- **Automation Workflows**: Can trigger based on correlation confidence scores

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Engine Development

- Minimal permission principle for API access

**Data Privacy:**

- Log analysis performed locally only
- No sensitive data transmitted to external services
- Respect GitHub API rate limits
- Audit trail for all automated actions

## Success Metrics

- % of workflows cancelled before failure (target: 80%+)
- Time saved through early cancellation (target: 50+ minutes/week)
- Cost savings through compute optimization (target: $20+/month)

**Pattern Recognition:**

- Accuracy of failure prediction (target: 90%+)
- Time to detect recurring patterns (target: <24 hours)
