# Founder's Circle Charter

This document outlines expectations for members of the Founder's Circle and clarifies the policy around the role.

## Expectations

- Participate in quarterly roadmap discussions and provide strategic guidance.

- Test pre-release features and report issues early.

- Uphold the community code of conduct at all times.

## Role Policy

Membership is by invitation only. Founder's Circle members may be listed as
advisers but hold no legal authority over the project. The maintainers reserve
the right to revoke membership if expectations are not met.
