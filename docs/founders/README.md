# Founder's Circle Onboarding

Members of the Founder's Circle help guide the long-term vision of the project.

## What We Ask
- Provide strategic feedback on features and roadmap direction.
- Participate in invite-only alphas and share insight on usability.
- Act as ambassadors and help spread the word once we launch.

## Perks
- Early or permanent access to new functionality.
- Recognition in project documentation.
- A direct line to the maintainers for major decisions.

## Getting Started
1. Introduce yourself in the private Founder's Circle channel.
2. Review [docs/README.md](../README.md) to set up your environment.
3. Join scheduled feedback sessions or submit pull requests with improvements.
4. Add yourself to [../../FOUNDERS.md](../../FOUNDERS.md) so we can track contributions.

## Founder Feature Flag
Set `IS_FOUNDER=true` in your `.env.dev` file to unlock founder-only routes. The `.env.example` file lists this variable for reference.

Need a reference email? See [emails/founders_invite.md](../../emails/founders_invite.md) for a template you can adapt.
