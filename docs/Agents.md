# Agents â€” Service and Integration Roles (Codex-Driven Reference)

This document defines all agents (services, bots, integrations, and guards) in the TAGS ecosystem. Each entry describes the agent's purpose, configuration, and typical workflow so contributors and Codex automation can keep the platform healthy.

## Auth Server (Backend Agent)

**Purpose:** Provides Discord OAuth, role checks, JWT issuance, and user session endpoints.

**Key Endpoints:** `POST /api/discord/exchange`, `GET /api/auth/user`, `GET /api/verification/status`

**Environment:** Discord client credentials, role IDs, JWT secret and config.

**Typical Workflow:**
1. Receive code from frontend.
2. Exchange it for a Discord token and fetch roles.
3. Issue a JWT and session payload to the frontend.

---

## Frontend Session Agent

**Purpose:** Stores and refreshes JWTs, restores sessions, and applies RBAC checks client side.

**Key Files:** `src/hooks/useSession.ts`, `src/lib/auth/discord.ts`

**Environment:** Role IDs as `VITE_*`, session refresh interval.

---

## Role Guard (RBAC Agent)

**Purpose:** Restricts pages/components based on Discord roles in the current session.

**Key Files:** `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `src/components/auth/OwnerRoute.tsx`

---

## Discord Integration Agent

**Purpose:** Handles all Discord-specific OAuth flows and role lookups.

**Key Files:** Backend utilities in `src/utils/discord.ts`, frontend helpers in `src/lib/auth/discord.ts`

---

## Verification Agent

**Purpose:** Determines user verification status based on Discord roles or API lookup.

**Key Files:** `src/routes/verification/status.ts`, `src/utils/resolveUserRoles.ts`

---

## Session/JWT Agent

**Purpose:** Issues, validates, and rehydrates JWT sessions for the frontend.

**Key Files:** Backend utilities in `src/utils/jwt.ts`, session logic in `src/routes/auth/user.ts`

---

## Database Service (Postgres)

**Purpose:** Provides persistent storage for the auth and XP services.

**Key Files:** schema models in `src/devonboarder/auth_service.py` and migrations in `migrations/`.

**Environment:** Connection string defined by `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## DevOps/Infrastructure Agents

Examples include Traefik or Nginx for routing, Docker Compose for orchestration, and monitoring agents.

---

## Planned Agents / Stubs

Examples include a Discord bot/webhook agent and ID.me integration.

---

## Startup Healthcheck (Autocheck Agent)

**Purpose:** Exposes `/health` endpoints so CI/CD and Docker Compose can verify service readiness before running tests.

**Example Docker Compose Healthcheck:**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 2s
  retries: 10
```

---

## Agent Task Checklist

- [ ] Document each agent's purpose, key files, environment, and workflow.
- [ ] Update this file and the changelog when an agent changes.
- [ ] Ensure healthchecks pass for required services.

2. Update the environment table and health matrix if needed.
3. Record your changes in the revision history below and in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Deprecation & Retirement

When retiring an agent, mark the section as deprecated with the date and reason. Update the health matrix and remove references from code and docs.
