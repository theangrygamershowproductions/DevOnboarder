# Agents — Service and Integration Roles (Codex-Driven Reference)

> **Note**: The up-to-date agent documentation now lives at
> [agents/index.md](../agents/index.md). The remainder of this file is kept for
> legacy reference only.

This document defines all agents (services, bots, integrations, and guards) in the TAGS ecosystem.
Each entry describes the agent's purpose, configuration, and typical workflow so contributors
and Codex automation can keep the platform healthy.

<!-- This file is derived from the master merged draft provided during onboarding. -->

## Agent Service Map

| Agent Name          | Endpoint(s)         | Port | Healthcheck | Depends On | Status   |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |

| Auth Server         | `/api/*`, `/health` | 8002 | `/health`   | db         | updating |
| Discord Integration | `/oauth`, `/roles`  | 8081 | `/health`   | Auth, db   | verify   |
| Frontend Agent      | `/`, `/session`     | 3000 | N/A         | Auth       | stable   |
| XP API              | `/xp`, `/health`    | 8001 | `/health`   | db         | verify   |
| Database (Postgres) | N/A                 | 5432 | docker      | N/A        | stable   |

---

## Auth Server (Backend Agent)

**Purpose:** Provides Discord OAuth, role checks, JWT issuance, and user session endpoints.

**Key Endpoints:** `POST /api/discord/exchange`, `GET /api/auth/user`, `GET /api/verification/status`, `GET /health`

**Environment:** Discord client credentials, role IDs, JWT secret and config.

**Typical Workflow:**

1. Receive code from frontend.

2. Exchange it for a Discord token and fetch roles.

3. Issue a JWT and session payload to the frontend.

## XP API

**Purpose:** Provides onboarding and XP routes backed by the auth service database.

**Key Endpoints:** `GET /api/user/onboarding-status`, `GET /api/user/level`, `POST /api/user/contribute`, `GET /health`

**Environment:** Shares database connection via `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## Frontend Session Agent

**Purpose:** Stores and refreshes JWTs, restores sessions, and applies RBAC checks client-side.

**Key Files:** `src/hooks/useSession.ts`, `src/lib/auth/discord.ts`

**Environment:** Role IDs as `VITE_*`, session refresh interval.

---

## Role Guard (RBAC Agent)

**Purpose:** Restricts pages/components based on Discord roles in the current session.

**Key Files:** `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `src/components/auth/OwnerRoute.tsx`

---

## Discord Integration Agent

**Status:** Verify – exposes `/oauth` and `/roles` for account linking and role lookups.

**Purpose:** Handles Discord OAuth flows and role lookups.

**Key Files:** `src/discord_integration/api.py`

---

## Verification Agent

**Purpose:** Determines user verification status based on Discord roles or API lookup.

**Key Files:** `src/routes/verification/status.ts`, `src/utils/resolveUserRoles.ts`

---

## Session/JWT Agent

**Purpose:** Issues, validates, and rehydrates JWT sessions for the frontend.

**Key Files:** Backend utilities in `src/utils/jwt.ts`, session logic in `src/routes/auth/user.ts`

---

## Database Service (Postgres)

**Purpose:** Provides persistent storage for the auth and XP services.

**Key Files:** schema models in `src/devonboarder/auth_service.py` and migrations in `migrations/`.

**Environment:** Connection string defined by `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## DevOps/Infrastructure Agents

Examples include Traefik or Nginx for routing, Docker Compose for orchestration, and monitoring agents.

---

## Planned Agents / Stubs

Examples include a Discord bot/webhook agent and ID.me integration.

---

## Startup Healthcheck (Autocheck Agent)

**Purpose:** Exposes `/health` endpoints so CI/CD and Docker Compose can verify service readiness before running tests.

**Example Docker Compose Healthcheck:**

```yaml

healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 2s
    retries: 10

```

## Healthcheck Implementation Guide

Add a simple `/health` route in each service so CI and Compose can poll for readiness.

**Express:**

```js

app.get("/health", (req, res) => res.status(200).send("OK"));

```

**FastAPI:**

```python

@app.get("/health")
def healthcheck():
    return {"status": "ok"}

```

## CI Wait Example

Use a small loop in your workflow to wait for the auth service before running tests:

```yaml

- name: Wait for Auth service

  run: |
      for i in {1..20}; do
        if curl -sf http://localhost:8002/health; then
          echo "Auth is up"
          exit 0
        fi
        sleep 3
      done
      exit 1

```

---

## Agent Task Checklist

- [x] Document each agent's purpose, key files, environment, and workflow.

- [x] Update this file and the changelog when an agent changes.

- [x] Ensure healthchecks pass for required services.

- [x] Run `python -m diagnostics` to verify packages, service health, and env vars.

---

## Next Steps / Remediation Timeline

- [x] Implement `/health` in Auth

- [x] Add Docker healthcheck to compose

- [x] CI workflow update to poll `/health`

- [x] Env var audit/cleanup in `.env.dev`

- [x] Doc/Agents.md/Changelog update

- [x] Retire obsolete scripts

## Codex Observability

CI health and failure events are monitored by Codex. Future outages will trigger
an automated notification and suggested fix via Codex's reporting channel.

## \U0001F512 Security Policy for Tooling and Dependencies

To reduce the attack surface in CI/CD workflows:

- **Do not use Codecov** or any third-party coverage uploaders that execute

  remote scripts in CI.

- Avoid integrations that rely on `bash <curl | sh>` style commands.

- Vet all external tools for prior security incidents before adoption.

---

## How to Extend/Contribute

1. Add a new section following the same structure: purpose, key files, environment, typical workflow.

2. Update the environment table and health matrix if needed.

3. Record your changes in the revision history below and in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Deprecation & Retirement

When retiring an agent, mark the section as deprecated with the date and reason.
Update the health matrix and remove references from code and docs.

---

## Glossary

- **Agent:** Any service, bot, or integration that manages part of the TAGS platform.

- **RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control.

- **Codex:** The automation system that verifies docs and code quality.
