# DevOnboarder Engineer Assessment Work Item List (July 2025)

This checklist supports assessment of an engineer’s work on DevOnboarder, focusing on code quality, automation, testing, documentation, project alignment, community, and operational excellence.
Use for onboarding, review, or Codex-driven feedback.

---

## 1. Code Quality & Architecture

- [ ] Review code for modularity, separation of concerns, error handling, and clarity.

- [ ] Check adherence to `/docs/git-guidelines.md` in commit history and PRs.

- [ ] Validate use of ESLint, Prettier, and type safety (see `bot/package.json`, CI outputs).

## 2. Testing & CI/CD

- [ ] Confirm ≥95% test coverage (Jest, Pytest; check `tests/` and coverage reports).

- [ ] Evaluate test quality for critical paths (Discord commands, plugins, API).

- [ ] Ensure CI/CD (GitHub Actions, `docker-compose.ci.yaml`) blocks merges on test/coverage failures.

## 3. Documentation

- [ ] Audit all docs: setup, onboarding, troubleshooting (`docs/README.md`, `docs/git-guidelines.md`).

- [ ] Confirm Vale or similar linter enforces doc standards (`./scripts/check_docs.sh`).

- [ ] Ensure docs are updated for all major changes (including changelog, bot features, Codex integration).

## 4. Project Alignment & Roadmap

- [ ] Map progress to Strategic Rollup milestones (see `devonboarder_feature_rollup.md`).

- [ ] Verify Codex/Discord workflows exist and are documented, not just aspirational.

- [ ] Assess if project goals align with actual adoption and feedback.

## 5. Community & Transparency

- [ ] Publish/update Ethics Dossier (`docs/builder_ethics_dossier.md`, README links).

- [ ] Keep `FOUNDERS.md`, `ALPHA_TESTERS.md` up to date.

- [ ] Promote the repo via X, Dev.to, Discord; encourage external feedback.

## 6. Operational Readiness

- [ ] Test setup (local, Docker) with provided scripts; update `.env.example`, configs.

- [ ] Validate production/staging readiness using `docker-compose.prod.yaml`.

- [ ] Identify and document onboarding/operational pain points.

## 7. Codex/Discord Automation

- [ ] Implement/test `/qa_checklist` and other onboarding/automation bot commands.

- [ ] Run at least one Codex E2E prompt per milestone; log in `docs/codex-e2e-report.md`.

- [ ] Expand Codex automation to other routine project tasks.

## 8. Community Adoption & Feedback

- [ ] Make contribution guide clear in `README.md` (how to star, fork, submit issues).

- [ ] Proactively request feedback from new users/testers.

- [ ] Analyze/respond to feedback to improve onboarding and structure.

## Summary Table

| Area           | Status/Comments                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

| Code Quality   | Structured, modular, verify in code      |
| Testing        | 95% coverage enforced, test quality TBC  |
| Documentation  | Excellent, Vale enforced, review updates |
| Roadmap        | Strategic milestones, check progress     |
| Community      | Low adoption, visibility needed          |
| Ops            | Multi-env, robust, test setup            |
| AI Integration | Codex, Discord bot, validate E2E         |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate

- [ ] Validate CI/coverage enforcement and onboarding automation (`/qa_checklist`).

- [ ] Fill documentation gaps, especially around new features.

- [ ] Test local and Docker setup from scratch.

### Next 30 Days

- [ ] Promote project on social/developer channels.

- [ ] Run/document Codex E2E tasks.

- [ ] Solicit and act on community feedback.

### Long-Term

- [ ] Tune roadmap by integrating real user feedback.

- [ ] Expand automation with Codex/Discord for more tasks.

- [ ] Continue transparent project storytelling in docs.

**Usage**:

- Save as `docs/assessments/engineer_assessment_work_items.md`.

- Use as an onboarding or review template, or adapt as a GitHub Issue.

- Reference/automate with Codex or as part of your QA checklist flow.
