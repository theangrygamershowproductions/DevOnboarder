## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus Recommendation (September 2025)

### Week 1 Priority: Strategic Foundation

1. **Complete #1264** - Implement updated Priority Stack Framework
2. **Begin #1262** - GitHub Projects reorganization for better tracking
3. **Plan #1261** - Milestone documentation standardization rollout

### Success Criteria for Moving to Tier 2

- [ ] Priority Stack Framework documented and implemented
- [ ] GitHub Projects reorganized for logical scope tracking
- [ ] Milestone documentation standards established project-wide
- [ ] Team has clear priority decision-making process

### Strategic Rationale

**Why Strategic Foundation First**:

- **Organizational Efficiency**: Better systems make all future work more effective
