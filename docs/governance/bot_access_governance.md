# Codex Task List: Onboarder Bot Access & Governance

## 1. GitHub Permissions

| Task                                                                                                                                                               | Owner         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |

| - [ ] Audit all current GitHub bot/service account scopes and access levels for DevOnboarder automation.                                                           | Security Team |

| - [ ] Restrict each bot to the minimum required **API scopes** for their tasks (e.g., `pull_requests`, `repo`, specific org permissions).                          | Security Team |

| - [ ] Migrate to **deploy keys** or machine users for CI/CD where possible, scoped only to specific repositories.                                                  | DevOps Team   |

| - [ ] Remove or avoid any unnecessary admin/org-wide tokens from automation scripts or workflow configs.                                                           | DevOps Team   |

| - [ ] Require GitHub Actions **Environments** for dev/staging/prod, with manual approval gates for sensitive (e.g., production) deployments.                       | DevOps Team   |

| - [ ] Configure **secrets management** in GitHub Actions: ensure only workflows in the correct environment can access relevant secrets, using OIDC where feasible. | DevOps Team   |

| - [ ] Rotate all access tokens/keys regularly; document the rotation schedule.                                                                                     | Security Team |

| - [ ] Ensure all bot actions (PRs, merges, issue edits, etc.) are logged and reviewable via the GitHub audit log.                                                  | Security Team |

## 2. Discord Permissions

| Task                                                                                                                                                      | Owner          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |

| - [ ] Review the OAuth2 scopes on all Discord bots; restrict to `bot` and `applications.commands` only.                                                   | Discord Admins |

| - [ ] Limit Discord bot permission bitmask to only the minimum (e.g., Send Messages, Use Slash Commands). Avoid “Manage Server” unless strictly required. | Discord Admins |

| - [ ] Implement Discord RBAC: restrict bot commands/visibility by channel and role as appropriate.                                                        | Discord Admins |

| - [ ] Document bot permissions and justify any elevated rights.                                                                                           | Discord Admins |

## 3. Pipeline & Environment Access

| Task                                                                                                                       | Owner       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |

| - [ ] Migrate all pipeline/service credentials to deploy keys or service accounts with limited repo access.                | DevOps Team |

| - [ ] Separate environment secrets for dev/staging/prod. Ensure prod secrets require manual approval for use in workflows. | DevOps Team |

| - [ ] Remove any broad Personal Access Tokens (PATs) or admin tokens from pipeline configuration.                          | DevOps Team |

| - [ ] Ensure all pipeline jobs log their activities (builds, tests, deployments) and store results for auditing.           | DevOps Team |

| - [ ] Configure alerting for failed builds, suspicious deployments, or pipeline anomalies.                                 | DevOps Team |

## 4. Metrics & Transparency

| Task                                                                                                                                                                        | Owner        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |

| - [ ] Implement metrics collection for the following: Open/closed issue and PR counts; last-activity timestamps; CI/CD health; code quality scans; Discord bot usage stats. | Metrics Team |

| - [ ] Set up an internal dashboard or report system for visibility of these metrics.                                                                                        | Metrics Team |

| - [ ] Document all metric sources and update methods.                                                                                                                       | Metrics Team |

## 5. Checks & Balances (Quarterly Review)

| Task                                                                                                    | Owner         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |

| - [ ] Schedule a **quarterly audit** of all bot/service account permissions in both GitHub and Discord. | Security Team |

| - [ ] Review GitHub audit logs and Discord audit logs for unexpected actions or privilege escalations.  | Security Team |

| - [ ] Revoke or rotate any unused or excess keys/tokens.                                                | Security Team |

| - [ ] Update and document permission scopes as project requirements evolve.                             | Security Team |

| - [ ] Treat each review as a lightweight security audit; document findings and any remediations.        | Security Team |

## 6. Documentation & Governance

| Task                                                                                                                             | Owner                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |

| - [ ] Maintain a public/visible governance document listing all bot/service accounts, their permissions, and last reviewed date. | Documentation Team      |

| - [ ] Add human approval gates and permission review tasks to the project management backlog as recurring items.                 | Project Management Team |

| - [ ] Link to relevant GitHub/Discord best practices and security docs.                                                          | Documentation Team      |

| - [ ] Keep the full matrix of bot secrets and permissions in `.codex/bot-permissions.yaml`.                                      | Documentation Team      |
