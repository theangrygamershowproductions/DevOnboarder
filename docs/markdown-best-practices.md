#  DevOnboarder Markdown Formatting Rules

Golden rules and best practices for writing lint-free markdown documentation in DevOnboarder.

## 🎯 Golden Rules for Lint-Free Markdown

The key to avoiding markdown linting errors is consistent spacing and structure.

### Essential Spacing Rules

The most important rules to follow:

1. **Headings:** Always surrounded by blank lines

2. **Lists:** Always surrounded by blank lines

3. **Code Blocks:** Always surrounded by blank lines

4. **Nested Lists:** Use 4 spaces for nesting

5. **No Trailing Spaces:** Except for line breaks (2 spaces)

### Style Consistency Rules

Additional formatting standards:

- **Emphasis:** Use asterisks, not underscores for _italic_ and **bold**

- **No Emphasis as Headings:** Don't use italics/bold as section headers

- **Reference Links:** Use descriptive text instead of "click here"

##  Quick Fix Commands

Common markdown linting errors and their solutions.

### Spacing Fixes

The most frequent issues and corrections:

```bash

# Add blank line before heading

# Change: content\n## Heading

# To: content\n\n## Heading

# Add blank line after heading

# Change: ## Heading\ncontent

# To: ## Heading\n\ncontent

# Fix list spacing

# Change: text\n- item

# To: text\n\n- item\n\nmore text

```

### Indentation Fixes

Fix nested list indentation:

```bash

# Fix nested indentation

# Change: - item\n  - nested (2 spaces)

# To: - item\n    - nested (4 spaces)

```

## 🎯 Prevention Strategy

How to avoid markdown errors from the start.

### Use the Template Approach

Create new documents using the compliant template:

```bash

# Generate lint-free markdown from template

bash scripts/create_lint_perfect_md.sh "my-doc" "My Title" "Description"

```

### Validate While Writing

Check formatting as you work:

```bash

# Check current file for errors

markdownlint docs/my-file.md

# Auto-fix simple formatting issues

markdownlint --fix docs/my-file.md

```

##  Approach Comparison

Reactive vs proactive markdown creation analysis.

### Time and Effort Analysis

| Approach      | Time Investment       | Error Rate | Frustration Level |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |

| **Reactive**  | Write  15min fixes   | High       | 😤 High           |

| **Proactive** | Template  validation | Low        | 😌 Low            |

### Best Practice Workflow

The recommended process for creating markdown:

1. **Start with template:** Use `scripts/create_lint_perfect_md.sh`

2. **Follow spacing rules:** Blank lines around headings, lists, code blocks

3. **Use 4-space indentation:** For all nested list items

4. **Validate frequently:** Run linter during writing process

5. **Fix immediately:** Don't accumulate formatting debt

## Conclusion

Template-driven markdown creation eliminates formatting errors.

**Result:** Lint-free documentation from the start! ✨
