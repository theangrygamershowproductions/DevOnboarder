# üõ†Ô∏è Onboarding: Documentation Quality Checks & Contribution Guide

## üöÄ Quickstart for Contributors

Welcome to the project! To keep our docs clear and professional, we run two tools:

* **Vale** ‚Äì style and terminology checks
* **LanguageTool** ‚Äì grammar and spelling

**You must pass both checks before pushing or opening a PR.**

---

### Step 1: Install All Dev Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

---

### Step 2: Install Vale

* On macOS: `brew install vale`
* On Windows: `choco install vale`
* Or see [Vale Installation Docs](https://vale.sh/docs/installation/) for other platforms
* **CI automatically installs Vale**, but you still need it locally to run the checks before committing.

---

### Step 3: (Optional) Set Up Local LanguageTool Server

By default the project uses the public LanguageTool API, but CI or firewalls may block it. For local use:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8010:8010 --name languagetool \
  quay.io/languagetool/languagetool:latest
export LANGUAGETOOL_URL="http://localhost:8010"
```

Set this environment variable in your shell or profile for all checks.

---

### Step 4: Run Documentation Quality Checks

Before every push or PR, run:

```bash
bash scripts/check_docs.sh
```

This generates `vale-results.json` for machine-readable output, which CI stores as an artifact.

CI also saves `pytest-results.xml` when running the test suite. You can download
both artifacts from the **Artifacts** section of each GitHub Actions run to
review Vale output and debug failing tests.

This will fail if Vale is missing, run both Vale and LanguageTool, and print issues by file, line, and column.

CI also uploads `pytest-results.xml` when the test suite runs in GitHub Actions. Visit a workflow run, open the **Artifacts** drop-down, and download the file to review which tests failed and why.

---

### Step 5: Pre‚Äëcommit Integration (Recommended)

Install pre-commit hooks so documentation and code checks run automatically:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

---

### Troubleshooting

* **Vale not found:** install it as shown above.
* **Python errors:** ensure `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` succeeded.
* **LanguageTool API issues:** run a local server and set `LANGUAGETOOL_URL`.
* **pytest fails:** double-check that all dev dependencies are installed.

* See [docs/CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for recent updates.
* For advanced configuration, check `.vale.ini` and `styles/DevOnboarder/`.
