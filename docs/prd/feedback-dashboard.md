# Feedback Dashboard PRD

This document defines the requirements for an internal dashboard that collects and surfaces community feedback.

## Objectives

- Centralize incoming reports from testers and founders.

- Provide maintainers with a clear view of bug reports and feature requests.

- Encourage transparency by showing progress on submitted items.

## Personas

- **Maintainer** – triages feedback and updates item status.

- **Alpha tester** – submits issues and monitors resolutions.

- **Founder** – reviews overall trends to steer the roadmap.

## Major Features

1. **Submission form** connected to the existing issue tracker.

2. **Status tracking** with states like "open", "in progress", and "closed".

3. **Analytics snapshot** summarizing the volume and type of feedback.

## Stretch Goals

- Real-time updates via WebSockets.

- OAuth login so testers can view their personal history.

- CSV export of all feedback metrics.
