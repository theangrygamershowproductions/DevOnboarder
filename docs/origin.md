# Origin Story

Between 2017 and 2021 everything collapsed. Health problems and cascading
infrastructure failures wiped away years of progress. Recovery started with
the basics: doctors, rest, and a strict routine to regain strength.

With health on track, identity followed. The plan was simple—celebrate small
wins, journal every obstacle, and script recurring fixes. Automation kept the
process steady. Documentation turned each lesson into a reproducible step.

Those habits shaped DevOnboarder’s modular design. Every component mirrors the
recovery path: short, repeatable tasks that work together. The goal is to give
others a stable base so they can avoid the turmoil that sparked this project.
