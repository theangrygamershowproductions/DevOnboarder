# Why This Project Exists

DevOnboarder isn't just code. It's a journey—a rebuilding of purpose, systems, and self.

## From System Collapse to System Rebuild

Between 2017–2021, the builder of this project lost nearly everything:

- A 24TB NAS full of code, documentation, and projects.

- Health events: concussions and spinal surgery (C4/C5 vertebral replacement).

- A period of physical and emotional pain masked through self-medication.

- A return to manual labor under unsafe conditions—and a principled walk-off.

- A business partnership break where ethics and effort no longer aligned.

This was not collapse. It was a reclamation moment.

## Rebuilding from the Ashes

After relocating and recovering in 2021, the builder:

- Returned to software, re-learning languages and workflows.

- Discovered AI tools like Codex and ChatGPT as avenues for resilience.

- Began rebuilding systems: journaling, CLI interfaces (`sf drop`, `sf ask`,

  `sf show`), DevContainer setups, Discord workflows, and GitHub CI/CD pipelines.

- Turned personal necessity into replicable tools for anyone who needs a fresh start.

## Not Sympathy — Humility & Growth

This story isn't shared for sympathy. Sympathy offers momentary comfort—it doesn't build futures.

What does build futures is **humility in failure**, the hard-earned clarity that follows—
and the willingness to teach what was learned.

DevOnboarder is a system born from that humility. It's modular. Tested. Functional.
It's designed to help others rebuild — not to elicit pity.

## Implications for Anyone Onboarding Here

- _You're joining a tool with history._ Every command, test, and commit comes from a place of hard-earned resilience.

- _You're working on more than code._ You're using insights shaped by loss, recovery, and systems rebuilding.

- _You're standing on a foundation forged by clarity under fire._ Humility isn't weakness here—it's the blueprint.

## What Comes Next

- Don't just use this tool—help build it forward.

- Add prompts, stories, features or test reflections.

- If this story resonates with you, your contributions can make it more accessible to others seeking to rise again.

## Closing Thoughts

"Your origin isn't your obstacle — it's your ignition."
