# Origin Story

Between 2017 and 2021, the system that held everything together fell apart. Health issues and cascading outages forced a hard reset. The setback was severe, but recovery came through steady work: fixing the body first, then rebuilding an identity around smaller, repeatable wins.

The process produced three lessons:

1. **Journaling is fuel.** Recording each failure and improvement turned confusion into a map forward.
2. **Automation prevents drift.** Replacing guesswork with scripts kept the recovery steps consistent.
3. **Documentation keeps momentum.** Writing down each fix and procedure meant no step was lost when focus slipped.

Those practices evolved into DevOnboarder. The project exists so others can skip the chaos and build on a clear, repeatable base.

*This origin is shared to explain the project’s purpose—not to seek pity.*
