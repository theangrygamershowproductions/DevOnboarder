# DevOnboarder Workflow Violation Prevention System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive branch workflow prevention system implemented to eliminate the recurring issue of working directly on the main branch in DevOnboarder.

## The Problem

Recurring pattern identified: Developers repeatedly starting work on the main branch instead of following proper feature branch workflow, leading to:

- Direct commits to main branch
- Workflow violations in CI
- Need for manual branch corrections
- Inconsistent development practices

## Prevention Architecture

### 1. Project Navigator Integration

**File**: `scripts/project_navigator.sh`

**Function**: `check_branch_workflow()`

**Purpose**: Pre-work validation to ensure proper branch before any development activity

**Features**:

- Automatic branch detection
- Interactive workflow guidance
- Feature branch creation assistance
- Session context preservation

### 2. Standalone Workflow Enforcer

**File**: `scripts/enforce_branch_workflow.sh`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive branch workflow validation and correction

**Modes**:

- **Interactive mode**: Full guidance and branch creation assistance
- **Pre-commit mode**: Silent validation for git hooks
- **Standalone execution**: Manual workflow checking

**Features**:

- Branch naming convention guidance
- Automatic feature branch creation
- Workflow compliance verification
- Prevention of main branch work

### 3. Quality Control Integration

**File**: `scripts/qc_pre_push.sh`

**Enhancement**: Added branch workflow validation to 95% QC checks

**Function**: Warns before pushing to main branch with option to abort

**Integration**: Part of comprehensive quality validation pipeline

### 4. Pre-Commit Hook Integration

**File**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

**Hook**: `enforce-branch-workflow`

**Purpose**: Automatic validation during git commit process

**Behavior**: Blocks commits to main branch at git level

## Usage Patterns

### For Developers

#### Starting New Work

```bash
# Use enhanced navigation system
./scripts/project_navigator.sh
# System automatically validates branch before showing menu
```

#### Manual Validation

```bash
# Run standalone enforcer
./scripts/enforce_branch_workflow.sh
# Provides interactive guidance and branch creation
```

#### Quality Control

```bash
# Run comprehensive QC including branch validation
./scripts/qc_pre_push.sh
# Includes branch workflow check in quality metrics
```

### For Git Operations

Pre-commit hooks automatically validate branch workflow:

```bash
git commit -m "message"
# Automatically runs branch workflow validation
# Blocks commit if on main branch
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

The system enforces DevOnboarder branch naming standards:

- `feat/feature-description` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/update-description` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/component-name` - Code refactoring
- `test/test-description` - Test improvements
- `chore/maintenance-task` - Maintenance tasks

## Technical Implementation

### Integration Points

1. **Project Navigator**: Pre-work branch validation
2. **QC Pipeline**: Quality gate enforcement
3. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Git-level prevention
4. **Standalone Script**: Manual checking and correction

### Error Handling

- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Multiple correction pathways (automatic and manual)
- Consistent messaging across all integration points
- Session context preservation during corrections

### Compliance Verification

```bash
# Verify current branch compliance
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)
if [[ "$current_branch" == "main" ]]; then
    echo "Workflow violation detected"
fi
```

## Benefits

### Prevention of Recurring Issues

- **Zero tolerance**: No work allowed on main branch
- **Systematic enforcement**: Multiple checkpoints prevent violations
- **Automatic correction**: Guided branch creation when needed
- **Consistent workflow**: Same standards across all development activities

### Developer Experience

- **Clear guidance**: Helpful error messages with solutions
- **Multiple entry points**: Various ways to validate and correct workflow
- **Integrated workflow**: Built into existing DevOnboarder tools
- **Educational**: Reinforces proper development practices

### Project Quality

- **Workflow consistency**: All developers follow same branch patterns
- **Main branch protection**: Prevents accidental commits to main
- **Quality integration**: Branch workflow part of QC standards
- **Automated enforcement**: Reduces manual oversight requirements

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### System Health

The prevention system includes self-monitoring capabilities:

- Branch workflow validation in quality control
- Pre-commit hook functionality verification
- Project navigator integration testing
- Standalone enforcer operational validation

### Updates and Evolution

System designed for extensibility:

- Modular component architecture
- Clear integration interfaces
- Documented extension points
- Version-controlled configuration
