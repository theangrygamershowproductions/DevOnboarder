# Phase 1 Critical Status Report

This document tracks the critical status of Phase 1 implementation in the DevOnboarder project.

## Phase 1 Overview

Phase 1 focuses on foundation stabilization and core system reliability:

- Infrastructure setup and configuration

- Core service deployment

- Basic authentication and authorization

- Essential CI/CD pipeline establishment

## Critical Status Items

### High Priority Issues

1. **Foundation Infrastructure**

   - Service containerization and orchestration

   - Database schema initialization

   - Environment configuration management

2. **Core System Stability**

   - Service health monitoring

   - Error handling and recovery

   - Performance baseline establishment

3. **Quality Gates**

   - Test coverage requirements (95% minimum)

   - Code quality standards enforcement

   - Documentation completeness validation

## Resolution Timeline

Phase 1 completion is critical for subsequent development phases and project timeline adherence.

## Next Steps

1. Address all critical infrastructure issues

2. Complete foundation stabilization testing

3. Validate quality gate enforcement

4. Proceed to Phase 2 planning
