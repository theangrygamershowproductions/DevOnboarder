# Phase 1 Critical Status Report

This document tracks the critical status of Phase 1 implementation in the DevOnboarder project.

## Phase 1 Overview

Phase 1 focuses on foundation stabilization and core system reliability:

- Infrastructure setup and configuration
- Core service deployment
- Basic authentication and authorization
- Essential CI/CD pipeline establishment

## Critical Status Items

### High Priority Issues

1. **Foundation Infrastructure**
   - Service containerization and orchestration
   - Database schema initialization
   - Environment configuration management

2. **Core System Stability**
   - Service health monitoring
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Performance baseline establishment

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Test coverage requirements (95% minimum)
   - Code quality standards enforcement
   - Documentation completeness validation

## Resolution Timeline

Phase 1 completion is critical for subsequent development phases and project timeline adherence.

## Next Steps

1. Address all critical infrastructure issues
2. Complete foundation stabilization testing
3. Validate quality gate enforcement
4. Proceed to Phase 2 planning
