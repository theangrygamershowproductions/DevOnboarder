# Token Architecture v2.1 - Audit System Documentation

## Overview

The DevOnboarder Token Architecture v2.1 includes a comprehensive audit system designed to maintain security compliance, track token health, and provide detailed reporting for security audits and regulatory requirements.

## Audit Components

### 1. Token Health Check (`scripts/token_health_check.sh`)

Performs comprehensive validation of all tokens in the environment:

- **Availability Check**: Verifies all expected tokens are present
- **API Functionality**: Tests GitHub API connectivity and permissions
- **Propagation Delay Detection**: Identifies tokens experiencing GitHub API delays
- **Health Scoring**: Calculates overall token architecture health percentage

### 2. Security Audit (`scripts/env_security_audit.sh`)

Validates security compliance across all environment files:

- **Production Secret Isolation**: Ensures no production secrets in committed files
- **Test Value Validation**: Confirms CI environments use safe test values
- **Gitignore Compliance**: Verifies sensitive files are properly excluded
- **Security Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential security violations

### 3. Audit Report Generator (`scripts/generate_token_audit_report.sh`)

Creates comprehensive audit reports including:

- **Executive Summary**: High-level security posture assessment
- **Detailed Findings**: Complete health check and security audit results
- **Compliance Status**: Token Architecture v2.1 compliance validation
- **Recommendations**: Actionable items for security improvements
- **Technical Metadata**: Environment context and audit tool information

### 4. Audit Management System (`scripts/manage_token_audits.sh`)

Provides lifecycle management for audit reports:

- **Report Listing**: Inventory of all generated audit reports
- **Status Monitoring**: Health statistics and retention compliance
- **Cleanup Operations**: Automated removal of expired reports
- **Retention Management**: 365-day retention policy enforcement

## Usage

### Quick Commands (via Makefile)

```bash
# Generate new comprehensive audit report
make audit-tokens

# Check audit system status and report inventory
make audit-status

# Clean up old audit reports (>365 days)
make audit-clean
```

### Direct Script Usage

```bash
# Generate audit report
bash scripts/generate_token_audit_report.sh

# Check token health only
bash scripts/token_health_check.sh

# Run security audit only
bash scripts/env_security_audit.sh

# Manage audit reports
bash scripts/manage_token_audits.sh [list|status|clean|generate]
```

## Audit Schedule Recommendations

### Monthly Audits (Required)

- Generate comprehensive audit reports
- Review security compliance status
- Address any failed health checks
- Document remediation actions

### Quarterly Reviews (Recommended)

- Token rotation assessment
- Security policy updates
- Audit process improvements
- Compliance documentation review

### Annual Compliance (Mandatory)

- Complete audit trail review
- Retention policy compliance
- Security incident analysis
- Third-party audit preparation

## Report Storage and Retention

### Location

All audit reports are stored in the `reports/` directory with the following naming convention:

```text
reports/token-audit-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md
```

### Retention Policy

- **Active Period**: Reports retained for 365 days
- **Archive Threshold**: Reports older than 90 days are marked for archival
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Reports older than retention period are automatically removed
- **Git Tracking**: All reports are staged for git tracking but not automatically committed

### Compliance Requirements

1. **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete audit history for minimum 12 months
2. **Access Control**: Restrict report access to authorized personnel only
3. **Change Documentation**: Document all token configuration changes
4. **Incident Response**: Establish procedures for token compromise scenarios

## Security Features

### No Default Token Policy v1.0 Compliance

The audit system validates compliance with DevOnboarder's No Default Token Policy:

- Validates fine-grained token hierarchy
- Warns about broad-permission fallback tokens
- Ensures proper token isolation and sandboxing

### Production Secret Protection

- Validates no production secrets in committed files (`.env.ci`)
- Ensures proper gitignore configuration
- Monitors for accidental secret exposure

### API Health Monitoring

- Tests token functionality against GitHub API
- Detects propagation delays for new tokens
- Provides detailed API error diagnostics

## Integration with CI/CD

### Pre-commit Validation

Token health checks can be integrated into pre-commit hooks to prevent committing broken token configurations.

### Automated Reporting

Audit reports can be automatically generated on schedule using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD systems.

### Security Gates

Failed security audits can block deployments until remediated.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Token Propagation Delays**
   - **Symptom**: New GitHub tokens fail API tests
   - **Solution**: Wait 2-5 minutes and re-run health check
   - **Prevention**: Allow propagation time after token creation

2. **Environment File Mismatches**
   - **Symptom**: Security audit reports inconsistencies
   - **Solution**: Run `bash scripts/smart_env_sync.sh --sync-all`
   - **Prevention**: Use centralized environment management

3. **Missing Audit Reports**
   - **Symptom**: Reports directory empty or missing
   - **Solution**: Run `make audit-tokens` to generate initial report
   - **Prevention**: Schedule regular audit generation

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Token Compromise**
   - Immediately revoke compromised tokens
   - Generate emergency audit report
   - Review access logs and recent changes
   - Implement new tokens following security guidelines

2. **Security Audit Failures**
   - Stop any deployment processes
   - Generate detailed audit report
   - Address all security violations before proceeding
   - Document remediation actions in audit trail

## Audit Report Format

Each audit report includes:

1. **Executive Summary**: Overall security posture
2. **Token Health Results**: Availability and API functionality
3. **Security Compliance Assessment**: Policy violations and recommendations
4. **Configuration Validation**: Token setup verification
5. **Recommendations**: Immediate actions and ongoing practices
6. **Technical Details**: Tool versions, environment context
7. **Metadata**: Report ID, timestamps, next audit schedule

## Compliance Framework

The audit system supports:

- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security monitoring and incident response
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy compliance
- **Internal Security Policies**: DevOnboarder-specific requirements

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- Automated audit scheduling via GitHub Actions
- Integration with external security monitoring systems
- Enhanced reporting formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)
- Real-time token health monitoring dashboard
- Integration with incident response systems
