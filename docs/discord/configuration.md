# Discord Server Configuration

This guide explains how to configure the Discord server used by the project.

## Steps

1. Create a new Discord server or choose an existing one.
2. Invite the DevOnboarder bot and grant it the permissions described in the README.
3. Configure channels and roles as needed for your community.
4. **Enable the Widget** in the server settings so the website can display the server's online status.

With the Widget enabled, the marketing site and other tools can show who is online without requiring users to open Discord.
