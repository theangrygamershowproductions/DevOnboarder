    "problem": "Discord OAuth callback was redirecting to wrong subdomain (auth.theangrygamershow.com instead of localhost) during local development, preventing proper testing of authentication flow in development environment.",
    "solution": "Implemented comprehensive environment-specific URL configuration pattern with AUTH_URL_DEV/PROD/CI variants, reorganized .env file structure for clarity, and fixed database initialization to support complete OAuth flow.",
    "outcome": "Complete end-to-end Discord OAuth flow now works in local development environment with proper localhost routing, database initialization, and JWT token generation. Development workflow maintains environment isolation while testing real OAuth integration."
