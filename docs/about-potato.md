## 🥔 About Potato

**Potato** isn’t just a root vegetable—it’s the heart and legend of this
project. “Potato” honors the founder’s unique spirit and the original spark
behind DevOnboarder. From humble beginnings, the Potato has been woven into
every phase of the workflow: immortalized in `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`,
`.codespell-ignore`, and more.

### Why Potato?

* **A Running Joke**
  What started as an inside joke soon became a symbol of creativity, humility,
  and perseverance in our engineering culture.
* **A Guardian**
  The presence of “Potato” and `Potato.md` in our ignore files reminds us never
  to take ourselves too seriously—and that every line of code carries a bit of
  our team’s story.
* **A Check**
  Our CI pipeline and pre-commit hooks protect Potato’s legacy, ensuring it is
  never accidentally removed and continues to travel with every branch, PR, and
  release.
