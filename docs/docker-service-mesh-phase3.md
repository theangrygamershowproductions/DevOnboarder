# Docker Service Mesh Phase 3: CI Service Validation Loop

## Overview

Phase 3 integrates Docker Service Mesh quality gates directly into the CI pipeline, creating an automated validation loop that enforces network contracts, service health, and artifact hygiene on every commit and PR.

## Key Features

### CI Pipeline Integration

- Automated quality gate validation in GitHub Actions
- Service health checks integrated into CI workflow
- Network contract enforcement on every build
- Artifact hygiene validation before deployment
- Coverage threshold enforcement across all services

### Automated Feedback Loop

- GitHub status checks for quality gate results
- PR blocking on quality gate failures (configurable)
- Automated issue creation for persistent violations
- Performance metrics collection and reporting
- Service discovery and validation automation

### Enforcement Modes

- **Strict Mode**: Block all merges on quality gate failures
- **Warning Mode**: Add status checks with optional approval override
- **Monitoring Mode**: Collect metrics without blocking
- **Emergency Override**: Allow bypass with explicit approval and audit trail

## Implementation

### CI Workflow Integration

```yaml
- name: Validate Service Mesh Quality Gates
  run: |
    bash scripts/validate_network_contracts.sh --phase=3 --strict
    bash scripts/validate_service_health.sh --all-services
    bash scripts/validate_artifact_hygiene.sh --enforce-centralized-logs
```

### Status Check Configuration

```yaml
- name: Set Quality Gate Status
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    script: |
      github.rest.repos.createCommitStatus({
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        sha: context.sha,
        state: 'success', // or 'failure'
        context: 'ci/quality-gates',
        description: 'All quality gates passed'
      });
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All CI runs include Phase 3 quality gate validation
- ✅ Quality gate failures block merges in strict mode
- ✅ Automated metrics collection and reporting active
- ✅ Service discovery and validation working end-to-end
- ✅ Zero false positives in quality gate enforcement

## Troubleshooting

- Check GitHub Actions logs for quality gate validation output
- Review `logs/validate_network_contracts_*.log` for detailed validation results
- Use `docker compose logs <service>` for service-specific health check issues
- Check GitHub status checks on PRs for quality gate results
