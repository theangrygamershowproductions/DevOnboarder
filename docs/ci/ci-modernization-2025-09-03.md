```toml

# pyproject.toml - Critical addition for CI/local parity
[project.optional-dependencies]
test = [
    # ... existing dependencies ...
    "types-requests",  # MyPy type stubs for requests library - CRITICAL for CI parity
]

```

**4. Repository Configuration Fixes:**

```bash

# Repository default branch correction (via GitHub API)
gh api repos/theangrygamershowproductions/DevOnboarder --method PATCH --field default_branch=main

# Branch protection rules optimization
gh api repos/theangrygamershowproductions/DevOnboarder/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks --method PATCH

```
