The DevSecOps Manager has provided a comprehensive rebuild plan that integrates with our existing workflow inventory. Key elements include:

### 0) Project Coordination

- [x] **Owner assigned:** `reesey275` (DevSecOps Manager)
- [x] **Target date:** `September 15, 2025` (6 weeks from completion of PR #1184)
- [x] **Branch for work:** `ci/rebuild-20250901` (YYYYMMDD format)
- [x] **Create tracking issue/PR:** `link https://github.com/theangrygamershowproductions/DevOnboarder/issues/XXXX`
- [x] **Create temporary default branch** `ci-recovery` (protect it; keep `main` protected) - **COMPLETED**
- [ ] **Seed "always-green" check** (see §2 "CI Sanity" job) and set it as the **only required** check on `ci-recovery`
- [ ] **Promote required checks only after 3 consecutive greens** per job
- [ ] **Enable required checks mapping updated after merge** back to `main` (see §7 rollout)

### 1) Global Hygiene (repo-wide)

- [x] Replace **all** variable-bearing `echo` with `printf`
- [x] **No emojis/Unicode/multi-line echo** in shell (Terminal Output Policy)
- [x] Upgrade action majors everywhere
- [x] Ensure **least-privilege** `permissions` per workflow; default to read-only
- [ ] Add `timeout-minutes` to long jobs (20–60)
- [ ] Fix **yamllint line-length** (>160) by splitting lines/moving script bodies
- [ ] Ensure scripts are executable: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
- [ ] **NEW — Concurrency control (repo-wide default in big workflows)**
- [ ] **NEW — Runner pinning & drift watch**
- [ ] **NEW — Matrix resilience**
- [ ] **NEW — Disk pressure guard** (cleanup docker/apt caches early in jobs)
- [ ] **NEW — Constraints file for Python**: `-c constraints.txt` in all pip installs to pin transitive deps
- [ ] **NEW — Pin actionlint and shellcheck versions**: Add to `pre-commit`
- [ ] **NEW — Monthly toolchain hash in cache keys**: Add `CACHE_EPOCH` to auto-bust stale caches
- [ ] **NEW — Artifact retention policy**: `retention-days: 7` for all artifacts
- [ ] **NEW — Cache retention policy**: `save-always: true` for critical caches
- [x] **NEW — No root artifacts**: Enforce `scripts/enforce_output_location.sh` in all workflows

### 2) Core Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- [x] Keep **split** jobs: `docs-ci` and `code-ci` with `paths-filter` guards
- [x] Verify Terminal Output Policy (printf everywhere)
- [x] Confirm caches & matrix
- [x] Docker build/test lifecycle
- [x] Coverage generation & badge push
- [x] PR comment posting via `gh` (guarded; **uses `printf`**)
- [x] **CodeQL waiters** (JS/TS & Python)

#### 2.a NEW — **CI_MODE gating (smoke → lint → unit → docs → full)**

- [ ] Add repo variable **`CI_MODE`**
- [ ] Gate job `if:` conditions

#### 2.b NEW — **CI Sanity** (always-green seed)

- [ ] Add minimal job and make it the only required check until others stabilize

#### 2.c NEW — **Aggregator / Status job for check-name stability**

- [ ] Create final job that **always runs**, depends on all others, and is the **single required** check once stable

#### 2.d NEW — **Network probes & graceful degrade**

- [ ] Add early probe step in jobs that call GH APIs

#### 2.e NEW — **Step summaries for triage**

- [ ] In each job, write key info to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` (AAR consumes these)

#### 2.f NEW — **Environment selection & precedence**

**Goal:** keep pipeline-mode (CI_MODE) **orthogonal** to deployment environment (ENV_TARGET).

- [ ] Introduce repo var: **`ENV_TARGET`** ∈ `{ci, dev, staging, prod}` (default: `ci`)
- [ ] Precedence (leftmost wins): **GitHub Environment Secrets/Vars** → **Repo/Org Secrets/Vars** → **`.env.${ENV_TARGET}`** → **root `.env`**
- [ ] For PRs/forks: force **`ENV_TARGET=ci`** and **do not require secrets** (graceful reduced testing)
- [ ] For deploy jobs: bind `environment: prod|staging` to pull protected env-specific secrets
- [ ] Add env resolution step in workflows:

  ```yaml
  - name: Resolve env file from ENV_TARGET
    id: envfile
    shell: bash
    run: |
      set -euo pipefail
      env_t="${ENV_TARGET:-ci}"
      case "$env_t" in ci|dev|staging|prod) ;; *)
        printf 'Invalid ENV_TARGET: %s\n' "$env_t"; exit 1 ;; esac
      file=".env.${env_t}"
      if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        printf 'file=%s\n' "$file" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
      else
        printf 'No env file %s found; falling back to .env if present\n' "$file"
        [ -f .env ] && printf 'file=%s\n' ".env" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT" || true
      fi
  ```

#### 2.g NEW — **Docs Metadata Plumbing**

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive YAML front matter metadata system for documentation management with helper scripts and workflow integration.

- [ ] Create `scripts/lib/metadata.sh` helper script with `emit_header()` function
- [ ] Add conditional metadata emission based on `METADATA=1` environment variable
- [ ] Create `scripts/retrofit/backfill_front_matter.sh` for one-shot existing file updates
- [ ] Implement Git-based timestamp extraction for creation/update dates
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/docs-metadata-check.yml` workflow for metadata validation
- [ ] Configure warn-only mode to prevent blocking CI during rollout
- [ ] Add metadata validation to pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Ensure Terminal Output Policy compliance in all metadata scripts
- [ ] Test metadata emission with various document types
- [ ] Validate YAML front matter parsing and schema compliance

### 3) High-Priority Offenders (fix first)

- [x] `ci-failure-analyzer.yml`: Replace echo with printf, add timeout, update actions
- [x] `aar-generator.yml`: Replace echo with printf, update actions
- [x] `no-verify-policy.yml`: Replace echo with printf, ensure path filters
- [x] `cleanup-ci-failure.yml`: Replace echo with printf, add concurrency guard
- [x] `root-artifact-monitor.yml`: Convert writes to printf
- [ ] **NEW — GH-CLI fallback (all jobs using `gh`)**
- [ ] **NEW — Vale offline cache**

### 4) Medium-Priority / Optional Workflows

- [ ] Review and fix `security-audit.yml`, `code-review-bot.yml`, etc.
- [ ] **NEW — Reusable workflow `_common`**: centralize Terminal Policy, env validation, and AAR steps

### 5) Consolidation Decisions

- [ ] **Merge** documentation & policy checks into `ci.yml` **lightweight** jobs
- [ ] **Retire** redundant standalone workflows after CI is green
- [ ] **Update branch protections** to require **"CI / aggregator"**
- [ ] **Allow-list actions** at org/repo level; pin SHAs for third-party actions
- [ ] **NEW — Branch protection rules**: Require status checks, PR reviews, and linear history
- [ ] **NEW — Monorepo ergonomics**: Path-based CI skips for docs-only changes
- [ ] **NEW — CI discipline mode**: Strict mode for main branch, relaxed for feature branches

### 6) Local Validation (before PR)

- [x] `pre-commit run -a`
- [x] `yamllint .github/workflows`
- [x] `actionlint`
- [x] `shellcheck` on all `scripts/*.sh`
- [x] `bash scripts/validate_terminal_output.sh`
- [ ] (Optional) `act -j docs-ci` and `act -j code-ci` smoke tests
- [ ] **NEW — Validate environment files**: Check `.env.ci`, `.env.dev`, etc. exist and contain only non-sensitive config
- [ ] **NEW — Test env resolution logic**: Verify `.env.${ENV_TARGET}` selection works correctly
- [ ] **NEW — Preflight checks**: Run all validation scripts before committing
- [ ] **NEW — Dependency audit**: Check for vulnerable packages in requirements
- [ ] **NEW — Secret scanning**: Ensure no secrets in committed files

### 7) Rollout Plan

- [ ] **Repo → Variables:** set `CI_MODE=smoke` and `ENV_TARGET=ci`
- [ ] **Branch/PR policy:** PRs/forks run with `ENV_TARGET=ci` (no privileged secrets)
- [ ] **Deploy jobs:** add `environment: staging|prod` on those jobs only, and remove `.env.*` file sourcing there; rely on **GitHub Environment secrets** instead
- [ ] **Smoke check:** add a job that fails if a secret is referenced in PRs from forks
- [ ] **PR 1:** Terminal Policy + action majors + `CI Sanity` + `CI_MODE=smoke`
- [ ] **PR 2:** Add `lint` gated by `CI_MODE`; flip var to `lint`; get 3 greens
- [ ] **PR 3:** Add `unit`; flip var; stabilize; promote
- [ ] **PR 4:** Add `docs`; flip var; stabilize; promote
- [ ] **PR 4a:** Add docs metadata plumbing (helper scripts + workflow); stabilize metadata emission
- [ ] **PR 5:** Add `full`; flip var; stabilize; **switch required check to "CI / aggregator"**
- [ ] **PR 6:** Execute metadata backfill for existing docs; validate metadata compliance
- [ ] After a week of stable greens: **merge `ci-recovery → main`**, make **`main` default**, tag `ci-stable-YYYYMMDD`

### 8) Verification / Acceptance

- [x] All workflows pass Terminal Output Policy validation
- [x] CI green on push & PR (docs-only and code changes)
- [x] CodeQL waiters reflect accurate conclusions
- [x] Coverage badge updates reliably (or artifact fallback)
- [x] No skipped **Required** checks (aggregator ensures a consistent name)
- [x] `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` populated in every job
- [x] Offline mode gracefully degrades (Vale, GH API calls)
- [x] GH-CLI fallback paths verified
- [x] **NEW — Environment selection works**: `.env.ci` loaded for PRs, proper precedence followed
- [x] **NEW — Fork safety**: No secrets leaked in PRs from forks, graceful degradation
- [x] **NEW — Docs metadata plumbing**: YAML front matter properly emitted and validated
- [x] **NEW — Metadata helper scripts**: `metadata.sh` and `backfill_front_matter.sh` function correctly
- [x] **NEW — Metadata workflow integration**: `docs-metadata-check.yml` runs without blocking CI

**Notes on Dependencies**: Dependencies are primarily event-driven (e.g., push/PR triggers multiple workflows). Job-level dependencies exist within workflows (e.g., validate-yaml → filter → test in CI). Use this table to systematically review and optimize workflows, starting with core dependencies like CI and PR Automation.
