# Pull Request Comment Template

This document provides standardized templates and guidelines for pull request comments in the DevOnboarder project.

## Comment Templates

### Code Review Feedback

#### Positive Feedback

```markdown
‚úÖ **Great work!** This implementation is clean and follows our coding standards.

## Highlights

- Excellent error handling

- Clear variable naming

- Proper test coverage

```bash

### Constructive Feedback

```markdown
üîß **Suggestion:** Consider refactoring this section for better readability.

## Recommendation

- Extract complex logic into separate functions

- Add inline comments for clarity

- Consider using more descriptive variable names

## Example

```python

# Current implementation

result = process_data(data, flag, config, user)

# Suggested improvement

processed_result = process_user_data(
    user_data=data,
    validation_enabled=flag,
    processing_config=config,
    current_user=user
)

```bash

## Critical Issues

```markdown

‚ùå **Critical Issue:** This change introduces a security vulnerability.

**Issue:** SQL injection risk in user input processing

**Impact:** Potential data breach and unauthorized access

**Required Action:** Implement parameterized queries before merge

## Resources

- [Security Guidelines](../security/guidelines.md)

- [Safe Database Practices](../security/database-security.md)

```bash

### Testing Feedback

#### Test Coverage

```markdown

üìä **Test Coverage Review:**

**Current Coverage:** 94.2%

**Target Coverage:** 95%+

## Missing Coverage

- Error handling in `process_payment()` function

- Edge cases in date validation logic

**Recommendation:** Add tests for uncovered code paths before merge.

```bash

### Test Quality

```markdown

üß™ **Test Quality Feedback:**

## Strengths

- Comprehensive happy path coverage

- Good use of mocking for external dependencies

- Clear test descriptions

## Improvements Needed

- Add edge case testing for boundary conditions

- Include negative test cases for error scenarios

- Consider adding integration tests for critical flows

```bash

### Documentation Feedback

#### Documentation Quality

```markdown

üìö **Documentation Review:**

## Strengths (2)

- Clear API documentation updates

- Good inline code comments

- Updated README with new features

## Missing

- Troubleshooting guide for new feature

- Configuration examples

- Migration instructions for breaking changes

```bash

### Documentation Compliance

```markdown

üìã **Documentation Compliance:**

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires attention

## Issues

- Missing markdown linting compliance (MD022, MD032)

- API documentation not updated for new endpoints

- Change log entry missing

**Action Required:** Please update documentation to meet project standards.

```bash

### Performance Feedback

#### Performance Review

```markdown

‚ö° **Performance Analysis:**

## Metrics

- Response time: 180ms (target: <200ms) ‚úÖ

- Memory usage: +15MB (acceptable) ‚úÖ

- Database queries: +2 queries (requires optimization) ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Recommendations

- Consider query optimization for the new search feature

- Add database indexes for frequently accessed fields

```bash

### Architecture Feedback

#### Design Review

```markdown

üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Review:**

## Design Strengths

- Follows established patterns

- Maintains service boundaries

- Good separation of concerns

## Design Considerations

- Consider async processing for long-running operations

- Evaluate caching strategy for frequently accessed data

- Ensure proper error propagation across service boundaries

```bash

## Comment Guidelines
