# Task Management

This project tracks work items in `codex.tasks.json`. Active tasks live under the `tasks` array.
When a task's `status` is set to `complete`, move it to the `completedTasks` array to keep the main list short.

1. Open `codex.tasks.json`.
2. Move any finished entries into `completedTasks`.
3. Commit the changes alongside your code updates.

Keeping completed items separate helps Codex automation and maintainers review progress quickly.
