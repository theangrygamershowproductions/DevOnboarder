## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive risk assessment framework for DevOnboarder's strategic repository split post-MVP. The analysis enables data-driven decision making for service boundary extraction with minimal operational disruption.

**Assessment Date**: August 4, 2025
**Status**: Pre-split readiness evaluation
**Methodology**: Service maturity analysis with risk-based prioritization

## Service Maturity Matrix

| Service | API Stability | Test Coverage | Database Coupling | Infrastructure Dependencies | Split Risk |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| **Discord Bot** | ‚úÖ Stable | ‚úÖ 100% | ‚ùå None | üü° Discord API only | **VERY LOW** |

| **Auth Service** | ‚úÖ Stable | ‚úÖ 96%+ | üî¥ High (Shared DB) | üî¥ Core dependency | **MEDIUM** |

| **Frontend** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Evolving | ‚úÖ 100% | ‚ùå None | üü° Build-only | **LOW-MEDIUM** |

| **XP System** | ‚ö†Ô∏è New | ‚úÖ 95%+ | üî¥ High (Shared DB) | üî¥ Cross-service API | **HIGH** |

| **Discord Integration** | ‚úÖ Stable | ‚úÖ 95%+ | üü° Medium | üü° OAuth flow | **MEDIUM** |

| **Feedback Service** | ‚ö†Ô∏è New | ‚úÖ 95%+ | üü° Medium | üü° Analytics deps | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |

### Risk Level Definitions

- **VERY LOW**: Independent service, stable API, minimal dependencies

- **LOW**: Clear boundaries, stable interfaces, manageable dependencies

- **MEDIUM**: Some coupling, requires coordination, moderate risk

- **HIGH**: Significant coupling, evolving API, complex dependencies

- **VERY HIGH**: Core system component, extensive coupling, high failure risk

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### VERY LOW RISK: Discord Bot

**Current State**:

- ‚úÖ **API Stability**: Mature Discord.js integration with stable command structure

- ‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: 100% coverage with comprehensive Jest test suite

- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Self-contained with only Discord API external dependency

- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: Independent deployment, no shared database

**Split Readiness**: **IMMEDIATE POST-MVP**

**Split Benefits**:

- Independent development cycles

- Simplified Discord bot-specific CI/CD

- Clear service boundary with Discord API

- No impact on other services

**Migration Complexity**: **MINIMAL**

- Copy bot/ directory structure

- Replicate Jest configuration patterns

- Set up Discord token management

- Independent deployment pipeline

### LOW-MEDIUM RISK: Frontend

**Current State**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **API Stability**: UI evolving based on user feedback, API contracts stabilizing

- ‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: 100% statements, 98.43%+ branches

- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Build-only, clear HTTP API boundaries

- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: Independent React/Vite build system

**Split Readiness**: **POST-MVP + 2-3 WEEKS**

**Split Benefits**:

- Frontend-specific development velocity

- Independent UI/UX iteration cycles

- Simplified frontend deployment pipeline

- Clear API contract enforcement

**Migration Complexity**: **LOW**

- Copy frontend/ directory structure

- Configure API endpoint environment variables

- Set up Vite build pipeline

- Independent static asset hosting

**Risk Mitigation**:

- Wait for UI/UX feedback from demo to stabilize

- Document API contracts before split

- Test cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration

### MEDIUM RISK: Auth Service & Discord Integration

**Current State**:

- ‚úÖ **API Stability**: Core authentication patterns established

- ‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: 96%+ with comprehensive integration tests

- üî¥ **Database Coupling**: Shared PostgreSQL database with user models

- üî¥ **Core Dependency**: All other services depend on authentication

**Split Readiness**: **POST-MVP + 4-6 WEEKS**

**Split Benefits**:

- Independent authentication service scaling

- Clearer security boundary management

- Simplified OAuth flow maintenance

- Service-specific database optimization

**Migration Complexity**: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

- Database schema extraction or replication

- JWT token validation across services

- Service discovery and health check patterns

- Cross-service session management

**Risk Mitigation**:

- Plan database migration strategy (shared vs. replicated)

- Implement service discovery patterns

- Test cross-service authentication flows

- Document API contracts extensively

### HIGH RISK: XP System & Feedback Service

**Current State**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **API Stability**: New services with evolving feature requirements

- ‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: 95%+ but limited production usage

- üî¥ **Database Coupling**: Extensive shared database integration

- üî¥ **Cross-Service Dependencies**: Complex integration with auth and user systems

**Split Readiness**: **DEFER UNTIL API MATURITY (POST-MVP + 8-12 WEEKS)**

**Why Defer**:

- API contracts still evolving based on user feedback

- Complex database relationships not yet optimized

- Cross-service integration patterns need stabilization

- Limited production usage data for optimization

**Future Split Benefits**:

- Independent gamification system scaling

- Specialized feedback analytics infrastructure

- Service-specific database optimization

- Clear user engagement API boundaries

**Preparation During Deferral**:

- Stabilize API contracts through production usage

- Optimize database queries and relationships

- Document cross-service integration patterns

- Plan service-specific database schema

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Database Coupling Mitigation

#### Strategy 1: Shared Database with Service Boundaries

- Maintain single PostgreSQL instance

- Implement service-specific schema prefixes

- Use database views for cross-service queries

- **Risk**: Tight coupling remains, schema changes affect multiple services

#### Strategy 2: Database per Service with Synchronization

- Extract service-specific databases

- Implement event-driven synchronization

- Use distributed transaction patterns where needed

- **Risk**: Data consistency complexity, synchronization overhead

#### Strategy 3: Gradual Database Extraction

- Start with shared database, identify service boundaries

- Extract read-only replicas for service-specific queries

- Gradually migrate to service-specific write operations

- **Recommended**: Lower risk, gradual migration path

### CI/CD Coordination Mitigation

**Multi-Repository Workflow Strategy**:

- Template current unified workflows for each service

- Implement cross-repository integration testing

- Use GitHub Actions matrix builds for coordination

- Maintain unified quality standards (95% coverage threshold)

**Service Integration Testing**:

- Docker Compose test environments for integration scenarios

- API contract testing between services

- End-to-end testing pipeline across repositories

- Automated rollback on integration failures

### Shared Utility Management

#### Strategy 1: Duplicate Utilities

- Copy shared utilities to each service repository

- Accept code duplication for service independence

- **Trade-off**: Maintenance overhead vs. independence

#### Strategy 2: Shared Library Package

- Extract utilities to npm/PyPI packages

- Version shared utilities independently

- **Trade-off**: Dependency management vs. code reuse

#### Strategy 3: Service-Specific Utilities

- Refactor utilities to be service-specific

- Eliminate cross-service utility dependencies

- **Recommended**: Cleaner service boundaries, less coupling

## Split Execution Timeline

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback Triggers

- **Critical Integration Failures**: Cross-service API failures

- **Data Consistency Issues**: Cross-service data synchronization failures

- **Team Velocity Impact**: >30% reduction in development speed

### Rollback Procedure

1. **Immediate**: Revert DNS/load balancer to monorepo deployment

2. **Short-term**: Merge split service changes back to main repository

3. **Long-term**: Reassess split strategy with lessons learned

4. **Documentation**: Update risk assessment with failure analysis

## Implementation Recommendation

**Strategic Approach**: **Gradual Risk-Based Extraction**

1. **Start Small**: Begin with Discord Bot (VERY LOW RISK)

2. **Learn and Adapt**: Use initial split to refine processes

3. **Gradual Progression**: Move to higher-risk services with proven patterns

4. **Defer Complex Splits**: Wait for API maturity on high-risk services

**Key Success Factors**:

- Data-driven decision making using diagnostic tooling

- Comprehensive testing at each split phase

- Gradual migration with rollback capabilities

- Team capacity management for multi-repo maintenance

This risk assessment provides the foundation for strategic, low-risk repository splitting that preserves DevOnboarder's operational excellence while enabling service-specific optimization and scaling.
