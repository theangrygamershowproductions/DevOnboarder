# Quick Start: Committing Your Current Changes

You mentioned you're not sure what commit message to use for your current changes. Here's how the new tools can help:

## Current Situation

You have git utilities and documentation changes that need to be committed. Let's walk through using the new tools:

## Option 1: Learn First, Then Commit (Recommended for first time)

```bash

# 1. Learn about commit message patterns

./scripts/commit_message_guide.sh

# Select option 5 to analyze your current changes

# This will show you what files you have and suggest commit types

# Then select option 4 to use the interactive builder

# This will walk you through creating the perfect message step-by-step

```

## Option 2: Use Smart Suggestions (Recommended for regular use)

```bash

# 1. Use the enhanced commit script

./scripts/commit_changes.sh

# This will

# - Show you exactly what files are being committed

# - Analyze the files and generate 3-5 smart suggestions like

#   1. "FEAT(scripts): add git workflow utilities for safer sync operations"

#   2. "DOCS: add comprehensive git utilities documentation"

#   3. "CHORE(scripts): enhance git utilities with conflict detection"

# - Let you pick the best one or enter your own

```

## Option 3: Quick Reference

For your current changes (git utilities + documentation), good commit messages would be:

```bash

# If this is primarily about adding new git tools

FEAT(scripts): add comprehensive git workflow utilities with smart commit suggestions

# If this is primarily about documentation

DOCS: add git utilities documentation and commit message guidance

# If it's both equally

FEAT(scripts): add git utilities with comprehensive documentation and commit guidance

# If you added educational tools

FEAT(scripts): add commit message guide and enhanced git workflow utilities

```

## The Tools Will Help You Choose

The beauty of the new `commit_changes.sh` script is that it will:

1. **Show you exactly what's changing**: No more guessing what files are included

2. **Analyze the content**: It looks at file types and patterns to understand what you did

3. **Generate multiple suggestions**: You get 3-5 good options to choose from

4. **Learn patterns**: Over time you'll see what good messages look like

## Try It Now

Run this to see the smart suggestions for your current changes:

```bash
./scripts/commit_changes.sh

```

The script will analyze your staged files and give you intelligent options. You'll never have to guess again!
