# DevOnboarder Infrastructure Work TODO

## üéØ **Current Patch Status: READY TO CLOSE**

### ‚úÖ **Completed Work (Current Patch)**

- **Discord Integration API**: All 24 tests passing (95% coverage) ‚úÖ
- **FastAPI Dependency Testing**: Resolved pytest timing issues with SessionLocal mocking ‚úÖ
- **Test Design Investigation**: Identified root cause as import timing, not version compatibility ‚úÖ

---

## üöÄ **Future Infrastructure Patches**

### **PATCH 1: GitHub Actions Dependency Management**

**Priority: HIGH** | **Estimated Size: Medium**

**Requirements:**

- Enforce 30-90 day version window for all GitHub Actions dependencies
- Automated validation in QC pre-push and CI workflows
- Dependency update recommendations and tracking

**Files to Create:**

- `scripts/manage_github_actions_deps.py` - Dependency validator
- `scripts/update_github_actions.sh` - Automated updater
- `.github/workflows/dependency-check.yml` - CI validation

**Integration Points:**

- Update `scripts/qc_pre_push.sh` to include dependency validation
- Add to safe commit wrapper validation

---

### **PATCH 2: Script Testing Framework**

**Priority: HIGH** | **Estimated Size: Large**

**Requirements:**

- Systematic testing for 100+ scripts in `scripts/` directory
- 80%+ coverage requirement for critical scripts
- Integration with existing QC validation

**Files to Create:**

- `scripts/test_scripts.sh` - Script testing orchestrator
- `tests/test_scripts/` directory - Test infrastructure
- Individual test files for critical scripts:
    - `test_devonboarder_ci_health.py`
    - `test_qc_pre_push.py`
    - `test_safe_commit.py`
    - `test_enhanced_token_loader.py`

**Critical Scripts Requiring Tests:**

```bash
# Infrastructure Scripts (Priority 1)
qc_pre_push.sh
safe_commit.sh
enhanced_token_loader.sh
devonboarder_ci_health.py
manage_logs.sh

# Automation Scripts (Priority 2)
smart_env_sync.sh
run_tests_with_logging.sh
validate_internal_links.sh
anchors_github.py
```

---

### **PATCH 3: Component-Based CI Restructuring**

**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Estimated Size: Large**

**Requirements:**

- Separate CI workflows for each component
- Parallel testing by component type
- Individual coverage reporting

**Components:**

- **Framework**: 95%+ coverage requirement
- **Backend Services**: 96%+ coverage requirement
- **Bot**: 100% coverage requirement
- **Frontend**: 100% coverage requirement
- **Scripts**: 80%+ coverage requirement (new)

**Files to Update:**

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Split into component workflows
- `.github/workflows/framework-tests.yml` - New
- `.github/workflows/backend-services.yml` - New
- `.github/workflows/script-tests.yml` - New
- Update pre-commit hooks for component-specific validation

---

### **PATCH 4: Enhanced Quality Gates**

**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Estimated Size: Small**

**Requirements:**

- Update QC validation to include all new component types
- Enhanced error reporting and debugging
- Integration with AAR system for failure analysis

**Updates:**

- `scripts/qc_pre_push.sh` - Add script and dependency validation
- `scripts/safe_commit.sh` - Enhanced validation pipeline
- Documentation updates for new testing structure

---

## üìä **Benefits of Future Infrastructure Work**

### **Immediate Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ **Compliance**: GitHub Actions dependencies stay within required window
- ‚úÖ **Script Quality**: 100+ scripts get systematic testing and validation
- ‚úÖ **Component Isolation**: Clear separation of testing concerns
- ‚úÖ **Parallel CI**: Faster feedback loops with component-based testing

### **Long-term Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and maintain component-specific issues
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Component-based approach scales with project growth
- ‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**: Higher confidence in critical infrastructure scripts
- ‚úÖ **Developer Experience**: Clear testing guidelines and faster CI feedback

## üéØ **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Complete Current Patch**: Finish remaining 2 XP API test fixes
2. **PATCH 1**: GitHub Actions dependency management (quick win)
3. **PATCH 2**: Script testing framework (high impact)
4. **PATCH 3**: Component-based CI restructuring (architectural improvement)
5. **PATCH 4**: Enhanced quality gates (polish and integration)

---

## üìù **Notes**

- **Architecture Alignment**: All work aligns with DevOnboarder's "work quietly and reliably" philosophy
- **Quality Standards**: Maintains 95%+ coverage requirements across all components
- **Integration Points**: Builds on existing Token Architecture v2.1 and AAR system
- **Developer Experience**: Preserves fast feedback loops while improving quality gates
