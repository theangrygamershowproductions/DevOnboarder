# Framework Phase 2: Friction Prevention Framework

## Overview

The Friction Prevention Framework is a comprehensive collection of automation and productivity scripts designed to eliminate common development friction points in the DevOnboarder project. Building on the foundation of the Quality Assurance Framework (Phase 1), this framework focuses on streamlining workflows, enhancing developer productivity, and preventing common development bottlenecks.

## Usage Guidelines

### Prerequisites

1. **Virtual Environment**: Always activate the virtual environment before using framework scripts:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Feature Branch**: Work in feature branches, never directly on main:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Quality Gates**: Run QC validation before commits:

   ```bash
   ./frameworks/friction_prevention/workflow/qc_pre_push.sh
   ```

### Script Execution

Scripts can be executed directly from their framework locations:

```bash
# Automation scripts
./frameworks/friction_prevention/automation/automate_pr_process.sh

# Workflow scripts
./frameworks/friction_prevention/workflow/smart_env_sync.sh

# Productivity tools
./frameworks/friction_prevention/productivity/analyze_logs.sh

# Developer experience tools
./frameworks/friction_prevention/developer_experience/safe_commit.sh
```

### Integration with DevOnboarder Workflows

The Friction Prevention Framework integrates seamlessly with existing DevOnboarder workflows:

1. **Pre-commit hooks** can reference framework scripts
2. **CI/CD pipelines** can utilize automation scripts
3. **Developer workflows** benefit from enhanced tooling
4. **Quality gates** leverage validation scripts

## Framework Dependencies

### Quality Assurance Framework (Phase 1)

This framework builds upon the Quality Assurance Framework located at `frameworks/quality_assurance/`. Ensure Phase 1 is properly implemented before using Phase 2 scripts.

### System Requirements

- **Shell**: Bash/Zsh compatible
- **Python**: 3.8+ (for Python scripts)
- **Git**: Version control operations
- **Virtual Environment**: Mandatory for all operations

## Development Standards

### Terminal Output Compliance

All scripts comply with DevOnboarder's strict terminal output policies:

- No emoji usage in echo statements
- No variable expansion in echo commands
- Use printf for variable output
- Centralized logging patterns

### Code Quality

- **Shellcheck**: All shell scripts pass shellcheck validation
- **Pylint**: Python scripts meet quality standards
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and validation

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Framework Health

The framework includes monitoring capabilities:

- Script execution metrics
- Error rate tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Usage analytics

All framework logs are centralized in the project root `logs/` directory following DevOnboarder's centralized logging policy.

### Quality Metrics

- **Coverage**: Framework script coverage tracking
- **Reliability**: Error rate and success metrics
- **Performance**: Execution time monitoring
- **Adoption**: Usage pattern analysis

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Configuration Management**: Enhanced configuration system
2. **Integration APIs**: REST API endpoints for script execution
3. **Dashboard**: Web-based framework monitoring dashboard
4. **Automation Engine**: Advanced automation orchestration

### Extension Points

The framework is designed for extension:

- Plugin architecture for custom scripts
- Configuration-driven behavior
- Integration with external tools
- Modular component design

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure scripts have execute permissions
2. **Virtual Environment**: Always activate before script execution
3. **Path Issues**: Use absolute paths for script references
4. **Quality Gates**: Scripts must pass QC validation

### Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check `docs/` directory for detailed guides
- **Validation**: Use `validate_internal_links.sh` for link checking
- **Quality Control**: Run `qc_pre_push.sh` for comprehensive validation
- **Logs**: Check centralized logging for execution details

## Version Information

- **Framework Version**: 2.0.0
- **Implementation Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-27
- **Total Scripts**: 36 (20 automation + 11 workflow + 3 productivity + 2 developer experience)
- **Quality Threshold**: 95%+ validation compliance

**Note**: This framework represents a significant enhancement to DevOnboarder's automation capabilities. All scripts have been migrated from the main `scripts/` directory and organized according to their functional categories for improved maintainability and discoverability.
