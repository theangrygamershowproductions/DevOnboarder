echo "CORRECTED RECOMMENDATION:"

echo "   Confidence: HIGH"

echo "RATIONALE:"
echo "   - 64% health score violates our 95% quality standard"
echo "   - 36% CI failure rate indicates systemic issues"
echo "   - Large scope (46 files, 3590+ lines) compounds problems"
echo "   - Time to fix may exceed time for focused new PR"

echo "CORRECTED ACTION PLAN:"
echo "   1. CLOSE current PR #966 with lessons learned summary"
echo "   2. CREATE new focused PR addressing core issue only"
echo "   3. TARGET 95%+ health score from start"
echo "   4. Apply documentation quality lessons to new PR"
echo "   5. ONLY MERGE when 95%+ standard is achieved"

echo "BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION:"
echo "   - Maintaining 95% standard ensures code quality"
echo "   - Fresh start is more efficient than fixing 31-point deficit"
echo "   - Reduces technical debt and future maintenance burden"
echo "   - Sets proper precedent for all future PRs"

echo "QUALITY GATE ENFORCEMENT:"
