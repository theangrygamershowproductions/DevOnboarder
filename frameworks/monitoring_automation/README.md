### Cross-Framework Communication

```bash
# Example integration pattern
source frameworks/quality-assurance/validation/validate_log_centralization.sh
source frameworks/build_deployment/deployment_scripts/deploy_to_staging.sh
source frameworks/monitoring_automation/monitoring_scripts/monitor_ci_health.sh

# Deploy with monitoring
deploy_application_to_staging
monitor_deployment_health
```

## Usage Patterns

### Comprehensive Monitoring Setup

```bash
# 1. Start monitoring infrastructure
frameworks/monitoring_automation/monitoring_scripts/monitor_ci_health.sh --daemon

# 2. Enable health checks
frameworks/monitoring_automation/health_checks/mvp_health_monitor.sh --continuous

# 3. Configure alerting
frameworks/monitoring_automation/alerting_systems/ci-health-aar-integration --enable
```

### Orchestrated Deployment with Monitoring

```bash
# Development environment with full monitoring
frameworks/monitoring_automation/automation_orchestration/orchestrate-dev.sh --with-monitoring

# Production deployment with health checks
frameworks/monitoring_automation/automation_orchestration/orchestrate-prod.sh --health-check-enabled
```

### Emergency Health Assessment

```bash
# Quick health check across all systems
frameworks/monitoring_automation/health_checks/comprehensive_token_health_check.sh --emergency

# PR health assessment for critical issues
frameworks/monitoring_automation/health_checks/assess_pr_health_robust.sh --critical-path
```

## Quality Standards

### Script Requirements

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and graceful failure
- **Logging**: Centralized logging to `logs/` directory with structured output
- **Documentation**: Inline documentation and usage examples
- **Testing**: Integration with quality assurance framework
- **Security**: Security validation and compliance checking
- **Performance**: Efficient monitoring with minimal system impact

### Monitoring Standards

- **Plain ASCII Output**: Terminal output policy compliance (no emojis/Unicode)
- **Structured Logging**: JSON or structured format for automated processing
- **Alerting Thresholds**: Configurable alerting with reasonable defaults
- **Health Check Intervals**: Configurable monitoring intervals
