# Coverage Masking Solution - Implementation Complete

**Date**: September 5, 2025
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND VALIDATED
**Priority**: CRITICAL

## Summary

Successfully resolved the **coverage masking problem** where pytest-cov was tracking all imported modules despite `--cov=src/xp` specifications.

## Root Cause

`pyproject.toml` configuration `source = ["src"]` overrode command-line coverage scoping, causing all services under `src/` to be tracked regardless of specific service targeting.

## Solution Implemented

- **Service-specific `.coveragerc` files** that completely override main configuration
- **Command pattern**: `pytest --cov --cov-config=.coveragerc.servicename`
- **Perfect isolation**: XP service now reports 49 statements, 100% coverage (not masked by other services)

## Validated Results

- ✅ XP Service: 49 statements, 0 missed, 100% coverage
- ✅ Discord Service: 59 statements, 0 missed, 100% coverage
- ✅ No coverage masking: Each service reports only its own coverage

## Critical Files Created

- `.coveragerc.xp` - XP service isolation
- `.coveragerc.auth` - Auth service isolation
- `.coveragerc.discord` - Discord integration isolation
- `docs/COVERAGE_MASKING_SOLUTION.md` - Full documentation
- Updated CI workflow with service-specific configurations

## Next Steps

- Commit these changes to preserve the solution
- Update other services with their own `.coveragerc` files as needed
- Monitor per-service coverage trends for ROI-optimized testing

**Impact**: Transforms DevOnboarder from coverage-masked centralized testing to strategic per-service quality accountability.
