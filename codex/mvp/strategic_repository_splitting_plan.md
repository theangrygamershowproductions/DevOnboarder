# DevOnboarder Strategic Repository Splitting Plan

## Strategic Overview

**Mission**: Execute systematic repository separation post-MVP to enable independent service development while maintaining operational excellence and quality standards.

**Activation Trigger**: MVP completion + 80%+ split readiness score + service boundary maturation

**Timeline**: 6-week execution plan starting October 2025

## Current Strategic Position

### Split Readiness Assessment

**Current Status**: 60% readiness (validated by Strategic Split Readiness Diagnostic)

**Readiness Factors**:

- **Service Boundaries**: 70% mature - well-defined API contracts

- **Operational Patterns**: 65% established - CI/CD patterns proven

- **Quality Standards**: 95% consistent - unified quality gates operational

- **Team Readiness**: 50% prepared - requires post-MVP knowledge transfer

**Target for Activation**: 80%+ overall readiness

### MVP Integration Benefits

**Why Post-MVP Timing Is Optimal**:

- **Velocity Preservation**: Monorepo maintains integration speed during high-velocity MVP phase

- **Risk Reduction**: Avoids coordination complexity during demo preparation

- **Quality Consistency**: Unified standards through critical delivery period

- **Operational Maturity**: Proven patterns ready for replication across repositories

## Repository Splitting Strategy

### Phase 1: Service Extraction Preparation (Weeks 1-2)

#### Service Dependency Analysis

- **Complete API contract documentation** for all inter-service communication

- **Database schema separation** planning and validation

- **Shared utility extraction** to common packages

- **CI/CD template standardization** across future repositories

#### Infrastructure Preparation

- **Repository templates** creation with DevOnboarder standards

- **Quality gate replication** across independent repositories

- **Security scanning coordination** for distributed repositories

- **Documentation standards** propagation framework

### Phase 2: Sequential Service Extraction (Weeks 3-5)

#### Extraction Sequence (Risk-Based Priority)

**1. Discord Bot Service** (Week 3) - **Lowest Risk**

- **Rationale**: Minimal database dependencies, clear API boundaries

- **New Repository**: `devonboarder-discord-bot`

- **Independence Criteria**: Operates independently with same functionality

- **API Integration**: Maintained with Auth Service and XP System

- **Quality Target**: 95% test coverage in new repository

**2. Frontend Dashboard** (Week 4) - **Medium Risk**

- **Rationale**: Clear UI/API separation, established build patterns

- **New Repository**: `devonboarder-frontend`

- **Independence Criteria**: Independent deployment with API coordination

- **Integration Points**: Auth Service, XP API, Discord Bot status

- **Quality Target**: 100% test coverage maintained

**3. Auth Service** (Week 5) - **Higher Risk**

- **Rationale**: Central service with multiple dependents

- **New Repository**: `devonboarder-auth`

- **Independence Criteria**: JWT issuing with backward compatibility

- **Migration Strategy**: Gradual cutover with fallback mechanisms

- **Quality Target**: Zero service disruption during transition

### Phase 3: Integration Validation & Optimization (Week 6)

#### Cross-Repository Coordination

- **API contract validation** across all separated services

- **Performance testing** for distributed service communication

- **Security audit** of cross-repository authentication flows

- **Documentation completeness** verification

#### Quality Assurance Coordination

- **Unified quality dashboard** across multiple repositories

- **Cross-repository CI/CD coordination** for breaking changes

- **Security scanning** coordination and vulnerability management

- **Release coordination** strategies for dependent services

## Technical Implementation Framework

### Repository Template Standards

Each extracted repository will include:

```text
devonboarder-{service}/
├── .github/workflows/    # DevOnboarder CI/CD patterns

├── src/{service}/        # Service-specific code

├── tests/               # 95%+ coverage requirement

├── docs/                # Service documentation

├── scripts/             # Service automation

├── config/             # Service configuration

├── docker/             # Container configuration

└── .codex/             # Agent integration

```

### Quality Gate Replication

**Maintained Standards Across All Repositories**:

- **Test Coverage**: 95%+ maintained per repository

- **Security Scanning**: Zero critical vulnerabilities

- **Documentation**: Vale quality enforcement

- **Code Quality**: Consistent linting and formatting

- **CI/CD**: <5 minute build and deployment times

### Inter-Service Communication Framework

**API Contracts**:

- **OpenAPI 3.0** specifications for all service interfaces

- **Backward compatibility** guarantees during transition

- **Version management** for API evolution

- **Circuit breaker patterns** for resilience

**Authentication Coordination**:

- **JWT token validation** across services

- **Centralized user management** during transition

- **Role-based access control** preservation

- **OAuth flow coordination** for Discord integration

## Risk Management & Mitigation

### High-Risk Factors

#### 1. Service Interdependency Complexity

- **Risk**: Breaking changes affecting multiple services

- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive API contract testing and version management

- **Monitoring**: Automated cross-service integration testing

#### 2. Data Consistency Across Services

- **Risk**: Database synchronization issues during separation

- **Mitigation**: Staged data migration with rollback capabilities

- **Monitoring**: Real-time data consistency validation

#### 3. Team Coordination Complexity

- **Risk**: Increased coordination overhead with multiple repositories

- **Mitigation**: Automated coordination tools and clear ownership models

- **Monitoring**: Development velocity tracking across repositories

### Mitigation Strategies

**Technical Safeguards**:

- **Feature flags** for gradual service migration

- **Rollback procedures** for each extraction phase

- **Comprehensive monitoring** for service health across repositories

- **Automated testing** for cross-service compatibility

**Process Safeguards**:

- **Clear ownership models** for each extracted service

- **Communication protocols** for cross-team coordination

- **Documentation standards** maintained across all repositories

- **Quality assurance** processes replicated consistently

## Success Metrics & Validation
