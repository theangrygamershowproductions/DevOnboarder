## 📅 Week-by-Week Validation

### Week 1 (Aug 8-11): Foundation Validation

### Daily Checkpoints

```bash

# Day 1-2: Terminal Output Cleanup

bash scripts/validate_terminal_output.sh

# Target: 22 → ≤15 violations

# Day 3-4: Network Foundation

./scripts/scaffold_phase1_networks.sh
make up
./scripts/validate_network_contracts.sh

# Target: 3 network tiers operational

# Day 5: Integration Testing

docker network ls | grep devonboarder
docker exec backend-service ping auth-service

# Target: DNS resolution working

```text

#### Week 1 Exit Criteria:

- [ ] Terminal violations ≤10
- [ ] Network tiers: `auth_tier`, `api_tier`, `data_tier` created
- [ ] All services assigned to correct tiers
- [ ] Data tier isolated (internal network only)
- [ ] DNS-based service discovery functional

### Week 2 (Aug 12-17): Quality & Enforcement

### Daily Checkpoints:

```bash

# Day 3-4: CI Network Validation

git commit -m "test: network validation"

# Target: Pre-commit hooks active

# Day 5: End-to-End Testing

gh pr create --title "Test network enforcement"

# Target: CI blocks network violations

```text

#### Week 2 Exit Criteria:

- [ ] MVP Quality Gates active in pre-commit + CI
- [ ] Network contract validation enforcing zero violations
- [ ] CI pipeline blocks unauthorized network exposure
- [ ] Quality metrics: coverage, performance, security validated

### Week 3 (Aug 18-24): Advanced Infrastructure

### Daily Checkpoints:

```bash

# Day 1-2: Root Artifact Guard

bash scripts/enforce_output_location.sh

# Target: Zero root pollution with service isolation

# Day 3-4: Codex Catch System

bash scripts/check_coverage_decay.py

# Target: Tier-aware recovery paths

# Day 5: Integration Validation

./scripts/validate_advanced_infrastructure.sh

# Target: All advanced systems operational

```text

#### Week 3 Exit Criteria:

- [ ] Root artifact guard enhanced with network awareness
- [ ] Codex catch system operational with tier validation
- [ ] CI hygiene score improved with service isolation benefits
- [ ] Advanced infrastructure supporting network foundation

### Week 4 (Aug 25-30): Security & MVP Completion

### Buffer Week Priorities:

```bash

# Day 1-2: Token Security Enhancement

./scripts/validate_token_security.sh

# Target: Scoped tokens + network restrictions

# Day 3-4: Agent Documentation Updates

./scripts/validate_agent_documentation.sh

# Target: Mesh reflected in Codex metadata

# Day 5: MVP Handoff Validation

./scripts/mvp_completion_validation.sh

# Target: All criteria met, MVP ready

```text

#### Week 4 Exit Criteria:

## 🚨 Risk Monitoring

### Critical Path Risks

| Risk | Week | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------|------------|-------------|
| **Terminal cleanup delay** | 1 | Daily progress tracking | Parallel network setup |
| **Network complexity** | 1 | Incremental tier rollout | Rollback to basic networking |
| **CI integration issues** | 2 | Comprehensive testing | Temporary validation bypass |
| **Quality gate conflicts** | 2 | Phased activation | Selective enforcement |

### Success Indicators

#### Green Signals (Continue):

- Daily violation count decreasing
- Network validation tests passing
- CI pipeline stable with new enforcement
- Service performance within thresholds

#### Yellow Signals (Monitor):

- Service startup time increases >20%

#### Red Signals (Escalate):

- Terminal violations increasing
- Network foundation unstable
- CI pipeline failing consistently
- Service regressions detected
