# GitHub Projects Workflow Automation Plan

## üéØ **Objective**

Automate the complete workflow we just executed for creating, organizing, and tracking major infrastructure initiatives across DevOnboarder's three-project GitHub structure.

## üìã **Workflow We Just Completed (Manual)**

### Phase 1: Planning & Documentation

1. Created integrated task staging plan
2. Analyzed existing issues for alignment
3. Identified task dependencies and coordination points
4. Designed 4-week execution timeline

### Phase 2: Issue Creation & Labeling

1. Created necessary GitHub labels (docker, network, observability, coordination)
2. Created 5 new infrastructure issues with detailed specifications
3. Applied appropriate labels and priority classifications
4. Cross-referenced existing MVP issues

### Phase 3: GitHub Projects Integration

1. Added issues to Team Planning project (tactical execution)
2. Added strategic items to Roadmap project (long-term planning)
3. Added deliverables to Feature Release project (release management)
4. Verified project board integration and item counts

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates

1. Updated README.md with current project status
2. Enhanced project management framework section
3. Added live project URLs and status dashboard
4. Created project management placeholders

## ü§ñ **Automation Implementation Plan**

### **Script 1: Infrastructure Initiative Creator**

**File**: `scripts/create_infrastructure_initiative.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Creates comprehensive infrastructure initiative with full GitHub integration

INITIATIVE_NAME="$1"
INITIATIVE_TYPE="$2"  # infrastructure|feature|security|quality
TARGET_TIMELINE="$3"  # 2-week|4-week|8-week
PRIORITY="$4"         # P0|P1|P2

# Input validation and configuration
# Label creation (if needed)
# Issue template generation
# Multi-issue creation with dependencies
# GitHub Projects integration
# README.md status updates
```

### **Script 2: GitHub Projects Orchestrator**

**File**: `scripts/orchestrate_github_projects.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Intelligently distributes issues across the three-project structure

ISSUE_LIST="$1"      # JSON array of issue numbers
INITIATIVE_TYPE="$2" # Type determines project distribution strategy

# Team Planning: All tactical execution items
# Feature Release: Concrete deliverables and milestones
# Roadmap: Strategic items and long-term vision
# Cross-project coordination validation
```

### **Script 3: Project Status Synchronizer**

**File**: `scripts/sync_project_status.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Automatically updates README.md and project documentation

# Fetch current project statuses via GitHub CLI
# Generate status dashboard content
# Update README.md Project Status section
# Validate markdown compliance
# Create status change notifications
```

### **Script 4: Initiative Template Generator**

**File**: `scripts/generate_initiative_templates.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Generate comprehensive issue templates for infrastructure initiatives
with proper dependencies, success criteria, and integration points.
"""

# Template generation based on initiative type
# Dependency chain analysis and documentation
# Success criteria framework
# Integration points identification
# Markdown compliance validation
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Automation Architecture**

### **Core Components**

#### 1. **Initiative Configuration Framework**

```yaml
# config/initiative_templates.yaml
infrastructure_initiative:
  phases:
    - foundation
    - implementation
    - validation
    - documentation
  required_labels:
    - infrastructure
    - priority-level
    - initiative-type
  github_projects:
    team_planning: all_phases
    feature_release: deliverables_only
    roadmap: strategic_milestones
```

#### 2. **GitHub CLI Integration Wrapper**

```bash
# utils/github_api_wrapper.sh
# Standardized GitHub CLI operations with error handling
# Label management and validation
# Issue creation with template processing
# Project board item management
# Status tracking and reporting
```

#### 3. **Documentation Synchronization Engine**

```python
# utils/doc_sync_engine.py
# README.md project status updates
# Cross-reference validation
# Markdown compliance enforcement
# Project URL synchronization
```

## üìä **Automation Workflow Design**

### **Command Interface**

```bash
# Create new infrastructure initiative
./scripts/create_infrastructure_initiative.sh "Docker Service Mesh" infrastructure 4-week P0

# Add existing issues to initiative
./scripts/add_to_initiative.sh "Docker Service Mesh" 1107,1108,1109,1110,1111

# Sync all project statuses
./scripts/sync_project_status.sh

# Generate initiative progress report
./scripts/generate_initiative_report.sh "Docker Service Mesh"
```

### **Integration Points**

#### **GitHub Actions Workflow**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/initiative-automation.yml
name: Infrastructure Initiative Automation

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, closed]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      initiative_name:
        description: 'Initiative name'
        required: true
      initiative_type:
        description: 'Initiative type'
        required: true
        type: choice
        options:
          - infrastructure
          - feature
          - security
          - quality

jobs:
  auto_organize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Orchestrate GitHub Projects
        run: ./scripts/orchestrate_github_projects.sh

      - name: Update Project Status
        run: ./scripts/sync_project_status.sh

      - name: Validate Integration
        run: ./scripts/validate_initiative_integration.sh
```
