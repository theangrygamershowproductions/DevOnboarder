# Root Artifact Guard Enhancement Task

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Components

- `scripts/enforce_output_location.sh` - Detects root pollution
- `scripts/clean_pytest_artifacts.sh` - Cleans test artifacts
- `scripts/manage_logs.sh` - Log management system
- Root Artifact Guard enforcement in CI

### Identified Enhancement Opportunities

- Strengthen detection patterns
- Improve automated cleanup
- Enhanced reporting and metrics
- Integration with CI failure patterns

## Enhancement Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Detection Patterns

```bash
# Expanded artifact detection
detect_root_pollution() {
    # Python artifacts: .coverage*, pytest_cache/, .pytest_cache/
    # Node artifacts: node_modules/ in root
    # Build artifacts: dist/, build/ in root
    # Test artifacts: test-results/, coverage/
    # Log pollution: *.log files in root
    # Cache pollution: .cache/, __pycache__/ in root
}
```

### 2. Automated Prevention System

- Pre-commit hooks to prevent artifact creation
- CI integration to fail builds with violations
- Real-time monitoring during development
- Automatic cleanup triggers

### 3. Comprehensive Reporting

```bash
# Enhanced artifact reporting
generate_artifact_report() {
    # Violation count and trends
    # Directory size analysis
    # Cleanup recommendations
    # Integration with CI metrics
}
```

### 4. Integration with Existing Systems

- Link with terminal output cleanup
- Integration with coverage system
- CI failure pattern analysis
- Log centralization enforcement

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Validation

- Improved pattern matching for all artifact types
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Integration with file system watchers
- Automated violation reporting

### Cleanup Automation

- Scheduled cleanup routines
- Smart retention policies
- Safe cleanup with validation
- Recovery mechanisms for accidental deletion

### CI Integration

- Artifact validation in all workflows
- Failure reporting and tracking
- Integration with existing CI health monitoring
- Automated issue creation for violations

### Metrics and Monitoring

- Track artifact pollution trends
- Monitor cleanup effectiveness
- Report on CI hygiene metrics
- Integration with overall project health

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Zero tolerance for root artifact pollution
- [ ] Automated prevention and cleanup working
- [ ] CI integration provides clear reporting
- [ ] Metrics show improved project hygiene
- [ ] Integration with existing DevOnboarder systems

## Benefits

- Cleaner repository structure
- Improved CI reliability
- Better developer experience
- Enhanced automation reliability
