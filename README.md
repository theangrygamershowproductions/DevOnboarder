# DevOnboarder

This repository follows a **trunk-based** development workflow.

## Trunk-Based Workflow

- All stable code lives in the `main` branch.
- Short-lived branches are created off `main` for each change.
- Changes are merged back into `main` via pull requests after review.
- Feature branches are deleted after they are merged to keep history clean.
