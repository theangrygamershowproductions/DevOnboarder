# Framework Migration Roadmap: Multi-Version Phased Rollout

## Strategy Overview

**Approach**: Gradual migration over multiple DevOnboarder versions, using issue-driven development process similar to our current framework organization workflow.

**Philosophy**: Incremental progress with full testing and validation at each step, maintaining system stability while achieving organizational goals.

## Version-Based Migration Plan

### Version 1.x.x: Foundation Complete ✅

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Scope**: Hybrid framework structure established
- **Delivered**:
  - 11 comprehensive frameworks with full directory structure
  - Critical scripts preserved in `scripts/` for compatibility
  - 6 low-risk scripts copied to frameworks as proof of concept
  - Zero breaking changes to existing systems

### Version 1.x+1: Low-Risk Script Migration
**Target Timeline**: Next minor version
**Scope**: Migrate scripts with <5 references each

**Issue-Driven Development**:
- **Issue #1**: Migrate utility scripts to utility-management framework
- **Issue #2**: Migrate analysis scripts to data-management framework
- **Issue #3**: Migrate diagnostic scripts to system-monitoring framework
- **Issue #4**: Update documentation references for migrated scripts

**Success Criteria**:
- 20-30 additional scripts migrated
- All references updated via automated tooling
- Full CI/CD validation passes
- QC system maintains 95%+ threshold

### Version 1.x+2: Medium-Risk Script Migration
**Target Timeline**: Following minor version
**Scope**: Migrate scripts with 5-15 references each

**Issue-Driven Development**:
- **Issue #5**: Migrate environment setup scripts
- **Issue #6**: Migrate documentation processing scripts
- **Issue #7**: Migrate build automation scripts (non-critical)
- **Issue #8**: Create framework transition documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- 40-50 additional scripts migrated
- Framework usage reaches 30-40% of total scripts
- Development team familiar with framework structure
- Legacy compatibility maintained

### Version 1.x+3: Integration Script Migration
**Target Timeline**: Major version candidate
**Scope**: Migrate moderately-referenced scripts (15-50 references)

**Issue-Driven Development**:
- **Issue #9**: Migrate CI/CD workflow scripts (non-critical path)
- **Issue #10**: Migrate project management automation
- **Issue #11**: Migrate security validation scripts (non-critical)
- **Issue #12**: Update all framework documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- 60-80% of scripts in framework organization
- Framework structure becomes primary development pattern
- Legacy scripts/ used only for critical infrastructure

### Version 2.x.x: Critical Infrastructure Migration
**Target Timeline**: Major version (extensive testing required)
**Scope**: Migrate high-reference scripts (50+ references)

**Issue-Driven Development**:
- **Issue #13**: Plan migration of moderately-critical scripts
- **Issue #14**: Create comprehensive reference update automation
- **Issue #15**: Staged migration of QC system components
- **Issue #16**: Full framework documentation and training

**Success Criteria**:
- 90%+ framework organization achieved
- Only most critical scripts remain in legacy locations
- Full team adoption of framework structure

## Issue Management Strategy

### Per-Version Issue Creation

```bash
# Create milestone for each version
gh issue create --milestone "v1.x+1" --label "framework-migration" \
  --title "EPIC: Low-Risk Script Migration to Frameworks" \
  --body "Migrate utility and analysis scripts with minimal references"

# Create individual issues for each framework
gh issue create --milestone "v1.x+1" --label "framework-migration,utility-management" \
  --title "Migrate utility scripts to utility-management framework" \
  --body "Move helper and maintenance scripts with <5 references each"
```

### Issue Templates
- **Script Migration Issue Template**
- **Framework Enhancement Issue Template**
- **Documentation Update Issue Template**
- **Reference Update Issue Template**

### Validation Requirements Per Issue
- [ ] Scripts execute successfully from new location
- [ ] All references updated and tested
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline validation passes
- [ ] QC validation maintains 95%+ threshold
- [ ] Framework documentation updated
- [ ] Legacy compatibility preserved where needed

## Risk Management

### Low-Risk Migrations (Versions 1.x+1, 1.x+2)
- **Scripts with <15 references**
- **Automated reference updates**
- **Full rollback capability**
- **Standard CI/CD validation**

### Medium-Risk Migrations (Version 1.x+3)
- **Scripts with 15-50 references**
- **Enhanced testing requirements**
- **Staged rollout within version**
- **Extended validation period**

### High-Risk Migrations (Version 2.x.x)
- **Scripts with 50+ references (qc_pre_push.sh, etc.)**
- **Comprehensive testing suite**
- **Feature flag controlled rollout**
- **Extended beta testing period**

## Automation & Tooling

### Migration Utilities
```bash
# Per-version migration tools
frameworks/migration-tools/
├── v1.x+1/
│   ├── migrate_low_risk_scripts.sh
│   ├── update_references.py
│   └── validate_migration.sh
├── v1.x+2/
│   └── migrate_medium_risk_scripts.sh
└── tooling/
    ├── reference_analyzer.py
    └── framework_validator.sh
```

### Continuous Integration
- **Per-framework validation**
- **Reference integrity checking**
- **Legacy compatibility testing**
- **Framework structure validation**

## Benefits of Phased Approach

### ✅ Risk Mitigation
- Small, manageable changes per version
- Extensive testing at each phase
- Easy rollback at version boundaries
- Maintains system stability throughout

### ✅ Team Adoption
- Gradual learning curve for development team
- Framework patterns established incrementally
- Documentation evolves with implementation
- Best practices refined through experience

### ✅ Issue Tracking
- Clear progress visibility through GitHub issues
- Milestone-based planning and execution
- Individual accountability for framework components
- Historical record of migration decisions

### ✅ Quality Assurance
- QC system validates each migration phase
- Automated testing prevents regressions
- Framework standards maintained consistently
- Legacy compatibility preserved strategically
