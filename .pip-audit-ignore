# DevOnboarder pip-audit ignore configuration
# This file contains security vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed
# due to upstream maintainer decisions or lack of available patches
#
# CRITICAL: All ignored vulnerabilities must be documented in:
# docs/security-ignore-registry.md with quarterly review schedules
#
# GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp: Timing attack in python-ecdsa on P-256 curve
# - Affects: ecdsa 0.19.1 (required by python-jose for JWT functionality)
# - Severity: Low (timing attacks affect signing operations, not verification)
# - Status: No planned fix according to maintainers (considered 'out of scope')
# - Impact: DevOnboarder uses JWT verification (not signing) so minimal risk
# - First ignored: 2025-07-30
# - Next review: 2025-10-30
