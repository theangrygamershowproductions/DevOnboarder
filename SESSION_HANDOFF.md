- Plan Issue #1261 (milestone documentation standardization rollout)
- Continue Tier 2 capability expansion work per Priority Stack

## 📋 **Key Reference Points**

### **Priority Framework Status Update**

- **Master Reference**: Issue #1264 (Priority Stack Framework) - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- **Current Focus**: Strategic Foundation → Capabilities → Infrastructure → Process
- **Major Shift**: From crisis management to systematic strategic development
- **Decision Rule**: Build systems that make everything else more effective

### **Critical Context Changes Since September 5th**

- **Foundation Crisis RESOLVED**: Terminal output policy, MVP Phase 1, CI stability all complete
- **DaI Infrastructure OPERATIONAL**: Agent context loading, policy access, milestone framework live
- **Priority Tier Shift**: From "blockers/crisis" to "strategic foundation systems"
- **Next Phase**: Organizational systems development before technical implementation

### **Important Context Documents**

- **MILESTONE_LOG.md**: Contains DaI foundation milestone + performance metrics
- **PR #1334**: DaI transformational milestone (MERGED with 8.5-14x performance achievements)
- **Issue #1264**: Updated Priority Stack Framework with Strategic Foundation focus

### **GitHub Projects Status (Updated)**

- **Team Planning (Project 4)**: Needs reorganization per #1262 (current Tier 1 priority)
- **Strategic Planning**: Contains completed foundation work and new strategic priorities
- **Integration Platform (Project 7)**: Ready for Tier 2 capability expansion work

## 🔄 **Session Pickup Commands**

### **To Resume Current Work**

```bash
# 1. Confirm current state (should be clean main after DaI merge)
git status
git log --oneline -3

# 2. Review completed DaI milestone achievement
gh issue view 1329  # Original DaI planning issue (closed)
gh pr view 1334     # DaI milestone documentation (merged)

# 3. Check current priority work (Strategic Foundation)
gh issue view 1264  # Priority Stack Framework Implementation

# 4. Verify foundation infrastructure completion
echo "Terminal Output Policy: COMPLETE"
echo "MVP Phase 1: COMPLETE"
echo "DaI Foundation: OPERATIONAL with 8.5-14x performance gains"
```

### **To Continue Development**

```bash
# Focus on TIER 1 STRATEGIC FOUNDATION work
gh issue view 1264  # Priority Stack Framework Implementation (current priority)

# After #1264, move to GitHub Projects reorganization
gh issue view 1262  # Reorganize GitHub Projects by logical scope

# Then milestone documentation standardization
gh issue view 1261  # Standardize milestone documentation format

# Tier 2: Capability expansion when foundation complete
gh issue view 1287  # Training Simulation Module (TSM)
gh issue view 1256  # BRIDGE: Automatic Documentation Generation
```
