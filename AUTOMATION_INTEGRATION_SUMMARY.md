## ðŸ¤– Automation Integration (Answering "How do we add that to the automation process?")

### 1. Codex Agent Framework Integration

**File:** `.codex/agents/index.json`

```json
{
    "name": "Agent.DocumentationQuality",
    "role": "Enforces markdown formatting standards and documentation quality",
    "path": "agents/documentation-quality.md",
    "triggers": "Push events, PR creation, or manual dispatch",
    "output": "Formatted markdown files and quality reports"
}

```

### 2. GitHub Workflow Automation

**File:** `.github/workflows/documentation-quality.yml`

- **Triggers:** Push to markdown files, PR creation, manual dispatch
- **Actions:**
    - Automatic markdown formatting fixes
    - Lint checking with markdownlint-cli
    - Auto-commit formatting improvements
    - Quality report generation

### 3. Agent Specification Document

**File:** `agents/documentation-quality.md`

- Complete agent specification with YAML frontmatter
- Integration points with CI/CD pipeline
- Quality standards and enforcement rules
- Automated remediation procedures

### 4. Automation Scripts Created

| Script | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `scripts/close_resolved_issues.sh` | Comprehensive issue resolution with CI validation | âœ… Working |
| `scripts/validate_issue_resolution.sh` | Quick validation of resolution criteria | âœ… Working |
| `scripts/close_ci_batch.sh` | Batch processing for issue closure | âœ… Working |
| `scripts/fix_markdown_simple.sh` | Automatic markdown formatting fixes | âœ… Working |
