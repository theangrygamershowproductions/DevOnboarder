# DevOnboarder Workflow Failure Diagnostic Report

## Generated: 2025-10-06 07:33 UTC

## Executive Summary

Multiple systematic workflow failures identified across DevOnboarder's CI/CD infrastructure, primarily in 3 categories:

1. **GitHub CLI Installation Failures** (12 workflows affected) - ✅ **FIXED in PR #1778**
2. **GPG Signing Failures** (AAR Portal workflows)
3. **Post-Merge Cleanup Script Failures**

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. GitHub CLI Installation Issues ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause**: The custom setup-gh-cli action failed when workflows requested `version: stable` because the action only handled `version: latest`.

**Impact**: 12 workflows failing with 404 errors on URL: `https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/vstable/gh_stable_linux_amd64.tar.gz`

**Affected Workflows**:

- cleanup-ci-failure.yml
- ci-dashboard-generator.yml
- secrets-alignment.yml
- env-doc-alignment.yml
- review-known-errors.yml
- security-audit.yml
- prod-orchestrator.yml
- notify.yml
- dev-orchestrator.yml
- ci-health.yml (2 instances)
- staging-orchestrator.yml

**Resolution**: ✅ Fixed in PR #1778 - enhanced version resolution logic to treat both `stable` and `latest` the same way.

### 2. GPG Signing Failures - Generate AAR Portal ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause**: Dual issues identified and resolved:

1. GPG private key secret `AARBOT_GPG_PRIVATE` was missing from GitHub Secrets ✅ **FIXED**

2. Inconsistent naming convention: Using `AARBOT_` instead of `AAR_BOT_` ✅ **FIXED**

**Previous Error**: `gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.`

**Resolution**: New GPG key pair generated and configured.

**Current State**:

- ✅ `AAR_BOT_GPG_PRIVATE` secret: Added with new base64-encoded private key
- ✅ `AAR_BOT_GPG_KEY_ID` variable: Updated with new key ID (2EF19BAC905D2C41)
- ✅ `AAR_BOT_NAME` and `AAR_BOT_EMAIL` variables: Renamed from AARBOT_ convention

**Affected Workflows**: 3 workflows updated to use correct `AAR_BOT_` naming:

- aar-portal.yml
- aar-automation.yml
- test-gpg-framework.yml

**Log Evidence**:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$AARBOT_GPG_PRIVATE" | base64 -d | gpg --batch --import --quiet
# Results in: gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
```

### 3. Post-Merge Cleanup Script Issues

**Root Cause**: Script exits with code 1 after successfully closing CI failure issues.

**Behavior**: The `manage_ci_failure_issues.sh` script successfully:

- Extracts PR number from commit message (#1773)
- Finds CI failure issues (Issue #1777)
- Closes the issue with resolution comment
- But still exits with code 1

**Impact**: Post-merge cleanup workflows show as failed despite successful operation.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **GPG Secrets and Variables** ✅ RESOLVED

   **Resolution**: New GPG key pair generated and configured successfully.

   **Actions Completed**:
   - ✅ Generated new GPG key pair (Key ID: 2EF19BAC905D2C41)
   - ✅ Added `AAR_BOT_GPG_PRIVATE` secret with base64-encoded private key
   - ✅ Updated `AAR_BOT_GPG_KEY_ID` variable with new key ID
   - ✅ Renamed existing variables:
     - `AARBOT_GPG_KEY_ID` → `AAR_BOT_GPG_KEY_ID`
     - `AARBOT_NAME` → `AAR_BOT_NAME`
     - `AARBOT_EMAIL` → `AAR_BOT_EMAIL`
   - ✅ Updated workflow files to use correct `AAR_BOT_` naming convention
   - ✅ Updated all documentation references to new key ID

2. **Fix Post-Merge Cleanup Script**
   - Investigate `scripts/manage_ci_failure_issues.sh` exit code handling
   - Ensure script returns 0 on successful completion
   - Add proper error handling for edge cases

### Medium Priority Actions

1. **Monitor GitHub CLI Fix Effectiveness**
   - Watch for reduced failure rates in the 12 affected workflows
   - Validate PR #1778 resolves the issue completely once merged

2. **Improve Error Diagnostics**
   - Add better error logging to GPG setup steps
   - Consider adding validation steps before attempting GPG operations

### System Health Improvements

1. **Implement Proactive Monitoring**
   - Create alerts for systematic workflow failures
   - Add health checks for critical secret availability
   - Monitor workflow success rates trending

## Current Status

- ✅ **GitHub CLI Issues**: Fixed in PR #1778 (pending merge)
- ✅ **GPG Issues**: Resolved with new key generation and complete configuration
- ⚠️ **Cleanup Script**: Needs exit code investigation
- ✅ **Analysis Complete**: Comprehensive diagnostic completed with implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Update GitHub repository secrets and variables for AAR Bot GPG configuration
2. **Short-term**: Fix post-merge cleanup script exit handling
3. **Long-term**: Implement monitoring to prevent future systematic failures

## Helper Scripts Created

### GPG Key Generation (Used)

```bash
# Generated new GPG key pair with GitHub configuration instructions
bash scripts/generate_aar_bot_gpg_key.sh
# Result: New key ID 2EF19BAC905D2C41 configured successfully
```

## Repository Configuration Required

### GitHub Secrets (Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets)

- **ADD**: `AAR_BOT_GPG_PRIVATE` (base64-encoded GPG private key)

### GitHub Variables (Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables)

- **RENAME**: `AARBOT_GPG_KEY_ID` → `AAR_BOT_GPG_KEY_ID`
- **RENAME**: `AARBOT_NAME` → `AAR_BOT_NAME`
- **RENAME**: `AARBOT_EMAIL` → `AAR_BOT_EMAIL`

## ✅ UPDATE: External Toolkit Integration Security Hardening Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-06 (Post-Analysis Enhancement)

**Implemented Security Framework**: Following the diagnostic analysis, a comprehensive security hardening system has been implemented to prevent future proprietary information leaks while enabling agents to detect enhanced capabilities:

### Key Security Enhancements Added

1. **Deterministic Detection System** (`scripts/tooling/detect_enhanced.sh`)
   - Feature flag support: `DEVONBOARDER_ENHANCED=1`
   - Sentinel file detection: `~/.local/state/devonboarder/enhanced/.ok`
   - Feature probe capability for secure capability detection

2. **VS Code MCP Integration** (`.vscode/mcp.json`)
   - Official MarkItDown MCP server (`uvx markitdown-mcp@latest`)
   - Notion API integration (when secrets provided)
   - Fixed MCP server startup issues (corrected uvx package specification)

3. **CI Security Guardrails** (`.github/workflows/scan-proprietary-refs.yml`)
   - Automated scanning for secret tokens (`sk-*` patterns)
   - Proprietary identifier detection and blocking
   - PR-based validation to prevent leaks

4. **Documentation Standards** (Vale rules + metadata)
   - Enforced neutral capability language
   - Public-safe documentation patterns
   - Proper YAML frontmatter with security context

5. **Agent Integration Updates**
   - Updated copilot instructions with deterministic detection
   - Enhanced agent requirements with security boundaries
   - Verification script for end-to-end validation

### Verification Results

```text
Mode: STANDARD (baseline)
Enhanced Test: ENHANCED (feature flag works)
Security: CLEAN (no proprietary refs detected)
MCP Servers: ✅ Functional
```

**Impact**: DevOnboarder agents can now securely detect and utilize enhanced capabilities when available while maintaining strict separation between public repository and proprietary tooling.
