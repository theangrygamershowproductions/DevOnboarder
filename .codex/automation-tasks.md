# CI Enforcement Tasks

This document outlines the automation checks Codex uses to keep the CI workflow consistent. Each section lists the CI step responsible and what reporting it produces.

## 1. Language Versions

-   The main workflow tests Python **3.12** only and validates Node.js **20**.
-   `scripts/check_versions.sh` verifies these versions locally and in CI.
-   Results appear in the `Verify language versions` step log.

## 2. Workflow Linting

-   `validate-yaml` lints `.github/workflows/**/*.yml` using the shared `.github/.yamllint-config` rules.
-   The YAML log uploads as `yamllint.log` for troubleshooting when the job fails.

## 3. Dependency Checks

-   `pip check` runs after installation and again once the package is installed.
-   `pip-audit`, `bandit` and `npm audit --audit-level=high` fail the build on high severity issues.
-   Local equivalents exist in `scripts/check_dependencies.sh` and `scripts/security_audit.sh`.

## 4. Coverage Gate

-   Both Python and JavaScript tests must maintain **95%** coverage.
-   `pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=95` enforces this requirement.
-   The bot and frontend run `npm run coverage` with the same threshold.
-   Coverage summaries post to pull requests via `scripts/append_coverage_summary.sh` and are saved as artifacts.

## 5. Commit Message Linting

-   `scripts/check_commit_messages.sh` ensures messages follow the `<TYPE>(<scope>): <subject>` format.
-   CI fails and annotates offending commits when the format is violated.

## 6. Documentation Linting

-   `scripts/check_docs.sh` runs `markdownlint-cli2` and Vale.
-   Results upload as the `vale-results` artifact and fail the build on errors.
-   Contributors should also review [docs/bot-types.md](../docs/bot-types.md) to understand how the Discord bot differs from Codex agents.

## 7. CI Failure Handling

-   `codex.ci.yml` monitors `ci.yml` for failures and attempts `ruff --fix` and `pre-commit run --files`.
-   If the build still fails, the bot opens a `ci-failure` issue with logs and a short summary generated by `scripts/summarize_ci_failures.py`.
-   Subsequent successful runs automatically close these issues.

## 8. Bot Orchestration

-   All project bots must obey the permissions listed in `.codex/bot-permissions.yaml`.
-   Only orchestrator bots may notify humans. Other bots operate quietly and record results in CI logs or artifacts.

## 9. Permissions Validation

-   `scripts/validate-bot-permissions.sh` checks that each workflow token matches the policy in `.codex/bot-permissions.yaml`.
-   Builds fail when a bot requests a scope that is not allowed.

## 10. Known-Error Handling

-   `scripts/ci_failure_diagnoser.py` and `scripts/summarize_ci_failures.py` group recurring transient errors so maintainers can skip redundant investigations.
-   Summaries are posted to the CI failure issue for reference.

## 11. Centralized Notifications

-   All human notifications flow through `.github/workflows/notify.yml` using `gh workflow run notify.yml -f data=<json>`.
-   The workflow aggregates messages via `scripts/process_notifications.py` and comments on the operations issue.

## 12. Agent Standards

-   Documentation for each agent lives under `/agents` and begins with a `codex-agent` YAML header.
-   Every agent must be listed in `.codex/agents/index.json` and permissions are defined in `.codex/bot-permissions.yaml`.
-   CI regenerates environment variable tables with `scripts/regenerate_env_docs.py` and validates them with `scripts/check_env_docs.py`.
-   **HAND-OFF.md Requirement**: All bots/agents must create a `HAND-OFF.md` file when completing tasks, documenting work completed, validation performed, and ongoing automation status.

## 13. Bot Inventory

-   Run `python scripts/list-bots.py` to list all bots found in `.github/workflows` and `.codex/agents/index.json`.
-   The script reports any agents missing from `.codex/bot-permissions.yaml`.

## EnvVar Manager Integration

-   EnvVar Manager agent audits all ENVARS used in code, workflows, and agent docs.
-   Ensures .env.example files are present and correct in each project directory.
-   Notifies through `.github/workflows/notify.yml`.
-   Escalates via GitHub Issue if misalignment persists >24h.
-   Follows agent doc at agents/envvar-manager.md.

## markdown/fix-style-violations

-   Run `npx -y markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` to lint every Markdown file.
-   Address reported warnings or run `npx -y markdownlint-cli2 --fix "**/*.md"` for auto-fixable rules.
-   Commit the changes with a `STYLE(markdown):` message describing the cleanup.
-   Push the branch and open a pull request summarizing the style fixes.
