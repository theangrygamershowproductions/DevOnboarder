# Management Ingest Agent

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This agent is currently in dry-run mode.** All outputs are logged, but no live actions are executed.

## Overview

Processes executive commands and routes them to appropriate Discord servers based on environment in dry-run mode for safe integration testing.

## Dry-Run Behavior

**Input Processing**: Validates command structure and role permissions
**Authorization Check**: Verifies Discord role mapping without live API calls
**Output Simulation**: Logs intended actions without execution
**Integration Testing**: Validates service communication patterns

## Prerequisites

```bash

# Setup environment for dry-run testing

bash scripts/setup_discord_env.sh dev
export DISCORD_BOT_READY=false
export LIVE_TRIGGERS_ENABLED=false

# Verify dry-run configuration

python -m diagnostics --check-codex --dry-run

```

## Dry-Run Logic

**Command Flow**:

1. Parse executive command (CEO, CTO, COO directives)

2. Validate role permissions via DevOnboarder auth service (simulated)

3. Log intended Discord routing without actual webhook calls

4. Output structured response for CI validation

**Safety Guards**:

- All Discord API calls simulated

- No actual webhook notifications sent

- Role validation logged but not enforced

- All outputs captured in `.codex/state/management-log.json`

## Usage Examples

```bash

# Development dry-run testing

./scripts/trigger_codex_agent_dryrun.sh management-ingest dev

# CI integration testing

DEPLOY_ENV=dev CODEX_DRY_RUN=true python -m codex.agents.management_ingest

```

    "agent": "management-ingest",
    "mode": "dry-run",
    "input_command": "CTO security audit",
