# Coverage Orchestrator Agent

## Purpose

Analyzes test coverage reports, identifies gaps, and creates targeted test improvements to maintain high coverage standards.

## Thresholds

- **Minimum Coverage**: Branches ≥ 95%
- **Statement Coverage**: ≥ 95%
- **Function Coverage**: ≥ 95%
- **Line Coverage**: ≥ 95%

## Guardrails

- **Tests-only**: Agent only creates or modifies test files
- **Respect triage guard**: Honors CI triage guard blocking decisions
- **No source changes**: Never modifies application source code
- **Human review required**: All PRs require human approval before merge

## Capabilities

### Coverage Analysis

1. **Parse Coverage Reports**: Extract coverage data from CI artifacts
2. **Identify Gaps**: Find uncovered lines, branches, and functions
3. **Prioritize Improvements**: Focus on critical paths and new code
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor coverage trends over time

### Test Generation

1. **Unit Tests**: Generate focused unit tests for uncovered functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Create integration tests for uncovered workflows
3. **Edge Cases**: Add tests for uncovered conditional branches
4. **Error Handling**: Test error paths and exception scenarios

### Quality Assurance

1. **Test Validation**: Ensure generated tests actually improve coverage
2. **Code Review**: Generate clear PR descriptions explaining changes
3. **Documentation**: Update test documentation and README files
4. **Regression Prevention**: Add tests to prevent future coverage drops

## Implementation Strategy

### Workflow

1. **Monitor Coverage**: Regularly check coverage reports from CI
2. **Analyze Gaps**: Identify specific uncovered code segments
3. **Generate Tests**: Create targeted tests for uncovered areas
4. **Create PR**: Open focused PR with test improvements only
5. **Request Review**: Tag appropriate reviewers for approval

### File Targeting

- `tests/`: Primary location for new test files
- `src/**/*.test.ts`: Component-specific test files
- `__tests__/`: Jest test directories
- `spec/`: RSpec or other framework test directories

### Safety Measures

- **Sandbox Testing**: All generated tests run in isolated environments
- **Coverage Verification**: Confirm tests actually improve coverage
- **No Destructive Changes**: Never remove existing tests
- **Rollback Capability**: All changes can be easily reverted
