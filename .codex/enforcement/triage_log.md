**Justification**: [Business/technical rationale]
**Remediation Plan**: [How to resolve properly]
**Due Date**: [When fix must be completed]
**Assigned**: [Who will fix it]
**Status**: [Open/In Progress/Resolved]

## Active Triage Items

### [2025-08-08] SUPPRESSION CRITICAL - Initial Enforcement Infrastructure

**Reason**: Massive AAR system and suppression documentation commit blocked by pre-commit
**Scope**: 100+ files including AAR infrastructure, agent guidelines, policy documentation
**Bypass Method**: Commit staging interrupted due to markdown linting violations
**Justification**: Enforcement infrastructure itself needs to be committed to enable enforcement
**Remediation Plan**: Apply markdownlint auto-fix, commit enforcement infrastructure first, then address remaining violations systematically
**Due Date**: 2025-08-08 (immediate)
**Assigned**: @potato + Claude (supervised)
**Status**: In Progress

#### Details

This is the classic "chicken and egg" problem - we need to commit the enforcement infrastructure to enforce quality, but the enforcement infrastructure itself has quality violations that prevent committing.

Priority order:

1. Fix core enforcement files (NO_SHORTCUTS_POLICY, doc_lint_enforcer, etc.)
2. Commit enforcement infrastructure
3. Address remaining AAR system markdown violations using auto-fix tools
4. Establish enforcement baseline

#### Resolution

TBD - Currently applying systematic auto-fix approach

## Historical Patterns

### Common Bypass Reasons

1. **Infrastructure Bootstrap**: Initial enforcement setup requires committing enforcement tools
2. **Legacy Content**: Bulk imports from pre-enforcement era need systematic cleanup
3. **AI Agent Learning**: AI-generated content requires iteration to meet standards
4. **Emergency Fixes**: Critical production issues requiring temporary quality gate bypass

### Prevention Strategies

1. **Staged Rollout**: Implement enforcement incrementally to avoid bootstrap issues
2. **Auto-fix First**: Always attempt automated resolution before manual intervention
3. **AI Training**: Enhance AI agent compliance through better pattern recognition
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Defined process for legitimate bypasses with tracking

## Suppression Tracking

### Terminal Output Policy Suppressions

Currently none - suppression system implemented but no suppressions applied yet.

### Markdown Linting Suppressions

Currently none - auto-fix preferred over suppression for formatting issues.

### Agent Schema Suppressions

Currently none - schema violations should be fixed, not suppressed.

**Remember**: This log exists to maintain accountability during the transition to enforcement mode. Every entry should include a clear remediation plan and timeline. Bypasses without proper justification violate the enforcement philosophy.
