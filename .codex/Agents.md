# Codex Agent Policy

All documentation under `agents/` must start with a `codex-agent` YAML header. This header defines the agent name, its role, and other metadata used by automation. Each agent file must also appear in `.codex/agents/index.json` so Codex can map roles during orchestration.

All agents send humanâ€‘facing messages through the centralized `notify.yml` workflow. Trigger it with:

```bash
gh workflow run notify.yml -f data=<json>
```

The workflow aggregates notifications via `scripts/process_notifications.py` and posts them to a single issue instead of sending disparate emails.

See [../agents/index.md](../agents/index.md) for the full list of agents and sample YAML headers.
