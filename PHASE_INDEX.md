# DevOnboarder Phase Index

## Overview

DevOnboarder uses a **layered phase architecture** where multiple phase systems coexist to serve different strategic purposes. Each phase framework operates independently with its own scope and timeline.

## Active Phase Systems

### 🎯 Phase 2 Terminal Output Compliance ( COMPLETE)

**Canonical Documentation**: `milestones/2025-09/2025-09-19-infrastructure-phase2-terminal-output-compliance-complete.md`

**Purpose**: Terminal output standardization and compliance enforcement

**Scope**: Terminal output violations elimination and quality assurance framework

**Status**:  **COMPLETE** - Zero violations achieved (22  0)

**Achievement**: Transformational compliance implementation with Enhanced Potato Policy v3.0 and shell safety framework

**Evidence**: [Milestone Documentation](milestones/2025-09/2025-09-19-infrastructure-phase2-terminal-output-compliance-complete.md) | [PR #1516](https://github.com/theangrygamershowproductions/DevOnboarder/pull/1516)

###  Phase 3 Monitoring & Automation Framework ( COMPLETE)

**Canonical Documentation**: Framework implementation in `frameworks/monitoring_automation/`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive monitoring and automation infrastructure for DevOnboarder

**Scope**: 32 monitoring, automation, health check, and alerting system scripts

**Status**:  **COMPLETE** - All terminal output violations resolved and framework merged

**Components Delivered**:

- **Monitoring Scripts** (12 files): CI health monitoring, pattern analysis, validation systems
- **Automation Orchestration** (10 files): PR automation, environment orchestration, execution frameworks
- **Health Checks** (9 files): Service dependencies, token health, PR assessment, CI dashboard
- **Alerting Systems** (3 files): AAR integration, health monitoring, notification systems

**Key Achievements**:

- Zero terminal output violations (all emojis replaced with ASCII equivalents)
- DevOnboarder virtual environment compliance throughout
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- CI/CD ready with full quality gate compliance

**Evidence**: [PR #1545](https://github.com/theangrygamershowproductions/DevOnboarder/pull/1545) - Framework implementation merged September 20, 2025

###  MVP 3-Phase Development Timeline

**Canonical Documentation**: Multiple files in `codex/mvp/` directory

**Purpose**: Structured 6-week MVP delivery framework

**Phases**:

- Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization (Weeks 1-2)

- Phase 2: Feature Completion (Weeks 3-4)

- Phase 3: MVP Finalization (Weeks 5-6)

**Status**: Active execution timeline

**Note**: This phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

###  Token Architecture Enhancement Phases (Completed)

**Canonical Documentation**: `PHASE2_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`, `PHASE2_COMPLETE_STATUS.md`, `PHASE3_DEVELOPER_PLAN.md`

**Purpose**: Systematic token management system implementation

**Phases**:

- Phase 1: Critical Scripts (5/5 complete)

- Phase 2: Automation Scripts (7/7 complete)

- Phase 3: Developer Scripts (3/3 enhanced)

**Status**: Implementation successful - comprehensive Token Architecture v2.1

###  Documentation as Infrastructure (DaI) Framework

**Canonical Documentation**: `docs/troubleshooting/DOCUMENTATION_AS_INFRASTRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md`

**Purpose**: Implementation guidelines for Documentation as Infrastructure work

**Status**: Guidelines established - ready for implementation

**Critical Requirements**:

- Study existing DevOnboarder workflows to understand proper patterns

- Use plain ASCII text only - no Unicode, no emojis, no special characters

- Follow Token Architecture v2.1 systematically using existing scripts

- Test each piece incrementally rather than building everything at once

- Respect the charter requirements without violating core policies

**Note**: These guidelines are MANDATORY for any DaI implementation work.

**Note**: This phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

###  OpenAPI Phase 2 Integration (Post-MVP)

**Canonical Documentation**: Issue-based planning

**Purpose**: API contract formalization and tooling

**Scope**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration for service contracts

**Status**: Post-MVP scheduling

**Note**: This phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

### BUILD: Infrastructure Phase Systems (Various)

**Purpose**: Infrastructure modernization initiatives

**Examples**:

- Dashboard Modernization (Phases 1-4)

- Docker Service Mesh (Phases 1-3)

- Quality Gates Framework

**Status**: Multiple active initiatives

**Note**: Each infrastructure phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

### GROW: Post-MVP Strategic Planning

**Canonical Documentation**: `codex/mvp/post_mvp_strategic_plan.md`, `codex/mvp/strategic_repository_splitting_plan.md`

**Purpose**: Long-term platform evolution and scaling

**Scope**: Repository splitting, platform scaling, enterprise features

**Status**: Strategic planning framework

**Note**: This phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

###  Setup & Operational Phases

**Purpose**: Environment setup, installation, and operational procedures

**Scope**: Development environment configuration and maintenance

**Status**: Operational documentation

**Note**: These phase systems have their own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

## Phase Architecture Principles

### Layered Portfolio Model

```text
─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Strategic Planning (Post-MVP)       │ ← Long-term vision
─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ MVP Timeline (Tactical Execution)   │ ← 6-week delivery
─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Compliance Phases (Quality Gates)   │ ← Standards enforcement
─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Infrastructure (Platform Building)  │ ← Technical foundation
─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Operational (Setup & Maintenance)   │ ← Day-to-day operations
─────────────────────────────────────┘

```

### Non-Overlapping Scopes

- **Terminal Output Compliance**: Technical standards only

- **MVP Timeline**: Delivery framework only

- **Token Architecture**: Security implementation only

- **Infrastructure**: Platform capabilities only

- **Strategic**: Long-term planning only

### Integration Points

Phase systems coordinate through:

- **Issue coordination** (e.g., #1111 Integrated Task Staging)

- **Dependency management** (phases enable/require others)

- **Quality gates** (standards maintained across all phases)

- **Documentation cross-references** (linked but separate)

## Navigation Guidelines

### For New Contributors

1. **Identify the relevant phase system** for your work

2. **Read the canonical documentation** for that specific phase

3. **Do not mix phases** - each has distinct scope and timeline

4. **Check integration points** if work spans multiple phases

### For Phase Management

1. **Each phase system maintains its own documentation**

2. **Cross-references are allowed** but scope remains distinct

3. **Integration happens at defined coordination points**

4. **No phase merging or conflation**

## Maintenance

This index should be updated when:

- New phase systems are created

- Phase systems reach completion

- Major scope changes occur

- Integration points change
