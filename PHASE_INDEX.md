# DevOnboarder Phase Index

## Overview

DevOnboarder uses a **layered phase architecture** where multiple phase systems coexist to serve different strategic purposes. Each phase framework operates independently with its own scope and timeline.

## Active Phase Systems

### 🎯 Phase 2 Terminal Output Compliance (Active/Locked)

**Canonical Documentation**: `codex/tasks/phase2_terminal_output_compliance.md`

**Purpose**: Terminal output standardization and compliance enforcement

**Scope**: Locked to prevent scope creep - focused solely on terminal output violations

**Status**: Active implementation (22 violations → ≤10 target)

**Note**: This phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

### 🚀 MVP 3-Phase Development Timeline

**Canonical Documentation**: Multiple files in `codex/mvp/` directory

**Purpose**: Structured 6-week MVP delivery framework

**Phases**:

- Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization (Weeks 1-2)
- Phase 2: Feature Completion (Weeks 3-4)
- Phase 3: MVP Finalization (Weeks 5-6)

**Status**: Active execution timeline

**Note**: This phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

### 🔧 Token Architecture Enhancement Phases (Completed)

**Canonical Documentation**: `PHASE2_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`, `PHASE2_COMPLETE_STATUS.md`, `PHASE3_DEVELOPER_PLAN.md`

**Purpose**: Systematic token management system implementation

**Phases**:

- Phase 1: Critical Scripts (5/5 complete)
- Phase 2: Automation Scripts (7/7 complete)
- Phase 3: Developer Scripts (3/3 enhanced)

**Status**: Implementation successful - comprehensive Token Architecture v2.1

**Note**: This phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

### 📋 OpenAPI Phase 2 Integration (Post-MVP)

**Canonical Documentation**: Issue-based planning

**Purpose**: API contract formalization and tooling

**Scope**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration for service contracts

**Status**: Post-MVP scheduling

**Note**: This phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Phase Systems (Various)

**Purpose**: Infrastructure modernization initiatives

**Examples**:

- Dashboard Modernization (Phases 1-4)
- Docker Service Mesh (Phases 1-3)
- Quality Gates Framework

**Status**: Multiple active initiatives

**Note**: Each infrastructure phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

### 📈 Post-MVP Strategic Planning

**Canonical Documentation**: `codex/mvp/post_mvp_strategic_plan.md`, `codex/mvp/strategic_repository_splitting_plan.md`

**Purpose**: Long-term platform evolution and scaling

**Scope**: Repository splitting, platform scaling, enterprise features

**Status**: Strategic planning framework

**Note**: This phase system has its own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

### 🛠️ Setup & Operational Phases

**Purpose**: Environment setup, installation, and operational procedures

**Scope**: Development environment configuration and maintenance

**Status**: Operational documentation

**Note**: These phase systems have their own scope; do not merge or conflate with others.

## Phase Architecture Principles

### Layered Portfolio Model

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Strategic Planning (Post-MVP)       │ ← Long-term vision
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ MVP Timeline (Tactical Execution)   │ ← 6-week delivery
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Compliance Phases (Quality Gates)   │ ← Standards enforcement
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Infrastructure (Platform Building)  │ ← Technical foundation
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Operational (Setup & Maintenance)   │ ← Day-to-day operations
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Non-Overlapping Scopes

- **Terminal Output Compliance**: Technical standards only
- **MVP Timeline**: Delivery framework only
- **Token Architecture**: Security implementation only
- **Infrastructure**: Platform capabilities only
- **Strategic**: Long-term planning only

### Integration Points

Phase systems coordinate through:

- **Issue coordination** (e.g., #1111 Integrated Task Staging)
- **Dependency management** (phases enable/require others)
- **Quality gates** (standards maintained across all phases)
- **Documentation cross-references** (linked but separate)

## Navigation Guidelines

### For New Contributors

1. **Identify the relevant phase system** for your work
2. **Read the canonical documentation** for that specific phase
3. **Do not mix phases** - each has distinct scope and timeline
4. **Check integration points** if work spans multiple phases

### For Phase Management

1. **Each phase system maintains its own documentation**
2. **Cross-references are allowed** but scope remains distinct
3. **Integration happens at defined coordination points**
4. **No phase merging or conflation**

## Maintenance

This index should be updated when:

- New phase systems are created
- Phase systems reach completion
- Major scope changes occur
- Integration points change
