## ⚡ 60-Second Go/No-Go Check

```bash
# Branch protection matches file
./scripts/verify-branch-protection.sh

# Required checks match a real PR
PR=$(gh pr list --limit 1 --json number -q '.[0].number')
./scripts/assert_required_checks.sh "$PR"

# Workflow headers & policy notes
./scripts/audit-workflow-headers.sh
```

## � Emergency Procedures

### Roll-Forward (drift found)

```bash
./scripts/sync_required_checks_from_pr.sh <GREEN_PR_NUMBER>
```

→ Review auto PR → Merge.

### Roll-Back (unblock in emergency)

* Remove failing context from `protection.json`
* Apply via `gh api` → unblock → fix → re-add.

## 🕐 Autonomous Operation

```text
02:17 UTC → Drift Detection → Issue Creation  
03:23 UTC → Self-Healing Sync → Auto PR Generation  
Human Review → Merge PR → System Healed ✨
```

* Real-time PR guards block bad configs.
* Nightly drift scans detect any mismatch.
* Self-healing regenerates branch protection from a verified green run.
* Human role: review & approve.
