🏆 DIGITAL HERITAGE ACHIEVEMENT:
This represents the pinnacle of infrastructure automation - a system that truly embodies
"working quietly, reliably, and in service of those who need it" through actual autonomous
operation AND impossible-to-lose operational knowledge embedded in git history forever.

Even with organizational dissolution, GitHub changes, or external doc failures, the complete
fortress story, architecture, and emergency procedures survive in git DNA for decades.

MIC-DROP-STATUS: legendary-complete
EVOLUTION: quiet-reliability → autonomous-organism → self-healing-fortress → immortal-vault
MILESTONE: ci-fortress-v1.0-digital-heritage-engineering
DISCOVERY: git-show-fortress-v1.0-or-fortress-recover-script

# ## 🏆 **Digital Heritage Achievement**
#
# This fortress survives:
#
# * ✅ **Organizational dissolution** → git history survives forever
# * ✅ **GitHub UI changes** → git commands remain unchanged
# * ✅ **External documentation vanishing** → embedded knowledge remains
# * ✅ **Complete team turnover** → archaeological recovery possible
# * ✅ **Wiki system failures** → git archaeology unaffected
# * ✅ **Decades of change** → fortress-v1.0 tag provides instant access
#
# Even with just a bare git clone on an old drive found in 2035, a future maintainer can
# run `./fortress-recover.sh` or `git show fortress-v1.0` to access the complete operational
# universe, emergency procedures, and reconstruction instructions.
