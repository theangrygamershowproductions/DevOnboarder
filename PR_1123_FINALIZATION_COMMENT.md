# 🎯 DevOnboarder Universal Version Policy - PR #1123 Finalization

## ✅ **Version Policy Implementation Complete**

This PR finalizes DevOnboarder's transition to **Node 22.x + Python 3.12.x** universal policy with comprehensive CI consistency.

### 🔧 **Key Changes Applied**

1. **✅ Cache Buster Applied** - All workflows use `CACHE_BUSTER: v-node22-py312` to prevent stale dependency restores
2. **✅ Version Policy Audit** - New required status check ensures fail-fast validation on every PR
3. **✅ Engine Specifications** - Package.json and pyproject.toml enforce version requirements
4. **✅ Workflow Consistency** - All GitHub Actions use setup-node@v4 (Node 22) + setup-python@v5 (Python 3.12)
5. **✅ Terminal Output Policy** - AAR server cleaned of emoji violations for "quiet reliability"
6. **✅ Orchestrator Enhanced** - Comprehensive policy framework with environment-specific caching

### 🚀 **New Workflow: Version Policy Audit**

```yaml
name: Version Policy Audit
# Runs on every PR to ensure Node 22.x + Python 3.12.x compliance
# FAIL FAST: Blocks PRs with incorrect versions before expensive CI runs
```

**Required Status Check**: This workflow must pass before merge to prevent version drift.

### 📋 **Reviewer Checklist**

- [ ] **Node 22/Python 3.12 confirmed in CI logs** - Check version audit job output
- [ ] **AAR working directory respected** - `cd aar` commands work correctly
- [ ] **Cache buster applied** - New cache keys prevent stale restores
- [ ] **Terminal output policy compliance** - No emojis in console.log statements
- [ ] **Engine specifications added** - package.json + pyproject.toml enforce versions

### 🔍 **Pre-Merge Validation Commands**

```bash
# Verify local compliance
./scripts/enforce_version_policy.sh

# Install version policy pre-commit hook (optional)
./scripts/setup_version_hook.sh

# Validate AAR system with Node 22
cd aar && npm install && npm test
```

### 📊 **Expected CI Behavior**

- **Version Policy Audit**: ✅ PASS (new required check)
- **AAR System Validation**: ✅ PASS (working directory + Node 22 fixed)
- **Main CI Pipeline**: ✅ PASS (cache buster prevents stale dependencies)
- **All Other Workflows**: ✅ PASS (consistent versions across all jobs)

### 🎯 **Post-Merge Actions**

1. **Make Version Policy Audit required** - Add to branch protection rules
2. **Monitor CI consistency** - All workflows should use Node 22 + Python 3.12
3. **Document success pattern** - Update onboarding docs with new version requirements
