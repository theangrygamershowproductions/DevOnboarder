# Agent Roles and Responsibilities

## Overview

The Potato Orchestration Framework defines clear roles and responsibilities for different types of agents to ensure safe, predictable, and effective automation.

## Agent Classification

### System Agents

System agents handle infrastructure, routing, and safety concerns.

#### Router Agent

**Purpose**: Intelligent traffic direction based on context analysis

**Responsibilities**:

- Analyze incoming requests (PRs, issues, CI events)
- Apply routing rules based on labels, file paths, and CI status
- Direct requests to appropriate specialized agents
- Maintain routing audit trails

**Permissions**:

- Read repository metadata
- Apply labels to issues/PRs
- Create routing decision comments
- Access CI status information

**Guardrails**:

- No source code modifications
- No merge permissions
- Respect guard agent blocking decisions
- All routing decisions logged

#### Triage Agent

**Purpose**: Safe default handler for unlabeled requests

**Responsibilities**:

- Normalize labels based on PR content
- Add relevant review checklists
- Suggest appropriate reviewers
- Provide status updates and guidance

**Permissions**:

- Read repository data
- Apply organizational labels
- Create informational comments
- Access contributor information

**Guardrails**:

- Read-only operations only
- No code modifications
- No merge capabilities
- Human approval required for all suggestions

#### Guard Agent

**Purpose**: Safety mechanism preventing unsafe operations

**Responsibilities**:

- Monitor infrastructure health
- Detect known failure patterns
- Block automation during instability
- Escalate critical issues

**Permissions**:

- Read CI logs and status
- Block other agent operations
- Create high-priority alerts
- Access system health metrics

**Guardrails**:

- Fail-safe default (block when uncertain)
- Manual override capability for authorized personnel
- Complete audit trail of blocking decisions
- Automatic escalation for critical issues

### Domain Agents

Domain agents focus on specific technical areas.

#### Coverage Orchestrator

**Purpose**: Maintain and improve test coverage standards

**Responsibilities**:

- Parse coverage reports from CI
- Identify uncovered code segments
- Generate targeted test improvements
- Open test-only PRs for review

**Permissions**:

- Read CI artifacts and coverage reports
- Create and modify test files only
- Open PRs with test improvements
- Access historical coverage data

**Guardrails**:

- Test files only (no source code changes)
- Human review required before merge
- Minimum coverage thresholds enforced
- Respect guard agent blocking decisions

#### Documentation Agent

**Purpose**: Maintain documentation quality and consistency

**Responsibilities**:

- Validate documentation completeness
- Check for broken links and references
- Update API documentation from code changes
- Generate documentation for new features

**Permissions**:

- Read source code for documentation extraction
- Create and modify documentation files
- Run documentation generation tools
- Access repository history for context

**Guardrails**:

- Documentation files only
- No functional code modifications
- Preserve existing documentation structure
- Human review for significant changes

#### Security Agent

**Purpose**: Identify and address security concerns

**Responsibilities**:

- Scan for security vulnerabilities
- Check dependency security status
- Validate security best practices
- Generate security improvement suggestions

**Permissions**:

- Read all repository files for scanning
- Access security scanning tools
- Create security advisory issues
- Review dependency information

**Guardrails**:

- Read-only access to source code
- Security fixes require human review
- No automatic dependency updates
- Escalation for critical vulnerabilities

## Agent Lifecycle

### Activation

1. **Trigger Event**: PR, issue, CI event, or scheduled trigger
2. **Router Analysis**: Context analysis and routing decision
3. **Agent Assignment**: Selected agents receive work assignment
4. **Guard Check**: Safety validation before agent execution
5. **Agent Execution**: Agent performs assigned work
6. **Human Review**: Results presented for approval if required

### Coordination

- **Work Queues**: Agents process work from prioritized queues
- **State Sharing**: Shared context for coordinated operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling overlapping responsibilities
- **Resource Management**: Preventing resource contention

### Quality Assurance

- **Result Validation**: All agent outputs validated before application
- **Human Oversight**: Critical decisions require human approval
- **Rollback Capability**: All changes can be easily reverted
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all agent actions

## Best Practices

### Agent Design

- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has one clear purpose
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Default to safe behavior when uncertain
- **Idempotent Operations**: Agents can be run multiple times safely
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined permissions and capabilities

### Safety Measures

- **Least Privilege**: Agents have minimum necessary permissions
- **Human Oversight**: Critical operations require approval
- **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged and traceable
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic stopping of problematic agents

### Performance

- **Efficient Processing**: Agents complete work quickly
- **Resource Awareness**: Agents respect system resource limits
- **Graceful Degradation**: Agents handle failures gracefully
- **Monitoring**: Agent performance is continuously monitored

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Triage Agent

```yaml
agents:
  basic_triage:
    type: system
    role: triage
    permissions:
      - read_repository
      - apply_labels
      - create_comments
    guardrails:
      - no_code_changes
      - human_approval_required
```

### Coverage Orchestrator Configuration

```yaml
agents:
  coverage_orchestrator:
    type: domain
    role: coverage
    permissions:
      - read_ci_artifacts
      - modify_test_files
      - create_pull_requests
    guardrails:
      - test_files_only
      - minimum_coverage_thresholds
      - human_review_required
    thresholds:
      minimum_coverage: 95
      critical_coverage: 85
```

### Security Scanner

```yaml
agents:
  security_scanner:
    type: domain
    role: security
    permissions:
      - read_all_files
      - create_security_issues
      - access_security_tools
    guardrails:
