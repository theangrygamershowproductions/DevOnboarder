DevOnboarder Policy Quick Reference

Usage: devonboarder-policy [OPTION]

OPTIONS:
    terminal        Show Terminal Output Policy (ZERO TOLERANCE)
    triage          Show Issue Discovery & Triage SOP
    priority        Show Priority Stack Framework
    escalation      Show Emergency Escalation Procedures
    tokens          Show Token Architecture v2.1 info
    violations      Check for current policy violations
    all             Show all policies (default)

EXAMPLES:
    devonboarder-policy terminal     # Terminal output rules
    devonboarder-policy violations   # Run policy checks
    devonboarder-policy triage       # Issue management process

QUICK CHECKS:
    ./scripts/validate_terminal_output.sh     # Check terminal violations
    ./scripts/qc_pre_push.sh                  # Full quality validation
    ./scripts/smart_env_sync.sh --validate    # Environment consistency
