## Integration & CORS Testing Results

**Date**: $(date)
**Status**: All integration tests passed
**Architecture**: Multi-subdomain direct routing

### ðŸŽ¯ **Achievements**

1. **Service Integration Validation**
   - All 5 core services health checks passing
   - Cross-service communication verified
   - Dependency orchestration working properly

2. **CORS Configuration Success**
   - Multi-subdomain CORS origins properly configured
   - All FastAPI services using centralized CORS utility
   - Cross-origin requests validated

3. **Tunnel Connectivity Verified**
   - All 5 subdomains responding correctly
   - Response times within acceptable limits
   - Service routing through tunnel confirmed

4. **Architecture Validation**
   - Direct service mapping working as designed
   - No proxy overhead from Traefik elimination
   - Clean subdomain separation maintained

### ðŸš€ **Live Architecture**
