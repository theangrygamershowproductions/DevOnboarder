# safe_commit_enhanced.sh - Enhanced safe commit wrapper with improved error handling
# Addresses edge cases in pre-commit hook re-staging failures

set -euo pipefail

# Enhanced re-staging logic for pre-commit hook failures
#
# CRITICAL: This function returns 1 on FATAL errors that indicate repository
# corruption or inconsistency. Callers MUST check the return code:
#
# Example correct usage:
#   if ! handle_precommit_modifications "$msg" "$files" "$attempt"; then
#       echo "FATAL: Pre-commit modification handling failed" >&2
#       exit 1
#   fi
#
# Example INCORRECT usage (silent failure risk):
#   handle_precommit_modifications "$msg" "$files" "$attempt"
#   # Continues execution even on fatal errors!
#
# RECOMMENDED: Use safe_handle_precommit_modifications() instead, which
# automatically enforces proper error handling and prevents silent failures.
