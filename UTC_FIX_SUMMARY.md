# UTC Timestamp Infrastructure Fix - Quick Summary

## Issue Resolved

Fixed critical diagnostic accuracy issue where DevOnboarder scripts claimed "UTC" timestamps but used local time, causing 3-minute discrepancies with GitHub API.

## Changes Applied

- src/utils/timestamps.py: Standardized UTC utilities created
- scripts/ci-monitor.py: Fixed UTC mislabeling (line 254)
- scripts/generate_aar.py: Fixed UTC mislabeling (line 427)
- scripts/file_version_tracker.py: Fixed UTC mislabeling (lines 430, 134)
- docs/troubleshooting/TIMESTAMP_SYNCHRONIZATION_DIAGNOSTIC_ISSUE.md: Evidence documentation

## Evidence

This addresses the user's observation that diagnostics were "whack" when searching GitHub due to timestamp synchronization issues.

## Status

Infrastructure fix complete. QC validation tools added for future prevention.
