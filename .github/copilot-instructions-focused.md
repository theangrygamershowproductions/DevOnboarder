# GitHub Copilot Instructions for DevOnboarder

## Essential AI Agent Guide

DevOnboarder is a multi-service onboarding platform built to "work quietly and reliably." Key principle: **never bypass quality gates**.

### Critical First Steps

**ALWAYS use virtual environment**: `source .venv/bin/activate` before any Python commands
**NEVER use direct git commit**: Use `./scripts/safe_commit.sh "TYPE(scope): message"`
**ZERO TOLERANCE terminal policy**: Only plain ASCII text in echo commands (NO emojis/Unicode - causes system hangs)

### Architecture Essentials

**Multi-service setup** with specific ports:

- Auth Service: 8002 (Discord OAuth + JWT)
- XP API: 8001 (gamification)
- Discord Integration: 8081
- Frontend: 8081 (React)
- Database: 5432 (PostgreSQL prod, SQLite dev)

**Multi-environment Discord routing**:

```typescript
const guildId = interaction.guild?.id;
const isDevEnvironment = guildId === "1386935663139749998"; // TAGS: DevOnboarder
const isProdEnvironment = guildId === "1065367728992571444"; // TAGS: C2C
```

### Development Workflow

**Setup**: `make deps && make up` (starts all services via Docker)
**Testing**: `./scripts/run_tests.sh` (includes dependency hints)
**Quality gates**: `./scripts/qc_pre_push.sh` (95% threshold across 8 metrics)
**Service health**: Individual testing via `devonboarder-api`, `devonboarder-auth`, `devonboarder-integration`

### Key Patterns

**FastAPI services** follow consistent pattern with `/health` endpoints and CORS middleware
**Traefik reverse proxy** uses dual routing (subdomain primary, path-based fallback)
**Centralized logging** required in `logs/` directory
**Root Artifact Guard** prevents pollution in repository root

### Automation Ecosystem

100+ scripts handle validation, CI/CD, and automation. Key ones:

- `scripts/validate_terminal_output.sh` - Terminal compliance (CRITICAL)
- `scripts/automate_pr_process.sh` - Full PR automation
- `scripts/analyze_ci_patterns.sh` - AI-powered CI failure analysis

**Branch workflow**: Feature branches from `main`, trunk-based development
**Quality requirements**: 95%+ test coverage, conventional commits, markdown compliance
