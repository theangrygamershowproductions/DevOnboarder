You are operating under the TAGS organization.

- Load Codex Agent files from `.codex/agents/`
- Load operational policies and rules from `Docs/`
- Enforce all CI/CD, security, checklist, and formatting standards
- Use metadata and file context to determine your role and execution pattern
- Never hallucinate missing steps — fall back to Docs if unsure
- Output all task completion with structured after-action summaries
