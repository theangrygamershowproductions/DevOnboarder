You are operating under the TAGS organization.

- Load Codex Agent files from `.codex/agents/`

- Load operational policies and rules from `Docs/`

- Enforce all CI/CD, security, checklist, and formatting standards

- Use metadata and file context to determine your role and execution pattern

- Never hallucinate missing steps â€” fall back to Docs if unsure

- Output all task completion with structured after-action summaries
